usual - access default option-handling commands
<BR>
	for a mega-widget component
<H3><A NAME="M3">SYNOPSIS</A></H3>
<B>usual ?</B><I>tag</I>? ?<I>commands</I>?<BR>
<H3><A NAME="M4">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
The <B>usual</B> command is used outside of an <B>[incr&nbsp;Tcl]</B>
class definition to define the usual set of option-handling
commands for a component widget.  Option-handling commands
are used when a component is registered with the <B>Archetype</B>
base class via the &quot;<B>itk_component add</B>&quot; method.  They
specify how the component's configuration options should be
integrated into the composite option list for the mega-widget.
Options can be kept, renamed, or ignored, as described in the
<B>Archetype</B> man page.
<P>
It is tedious to include the same declarations again and again
whenever components are added.  The <B>usual</B> command allows
a standard code fragment to be registered for each widget class,
which is used by default to handle the options.  All of the
standard Tk widgets have <B>usual</B> declarations defined in
the <B>[incr&nbsp;Tk]</B> library.  Similar <B>usual</B> declarations
should be created whenever a new mega-widget class is conceived.
Only the most-generic options should be included in the <B>usual</B>
declaration.
<P>
The <I>tag</I> name is usually the name of a widget class,
which starts with a capital letter; however, any string registered
here can be used later with the <B>usual</B> command described
on the <B>Archetype</B> man page.
<P>
If the <I>commands</I> argument is specified, it is associated
with the <I>tag</I> string, and can be accessed later via
<B>itk_component add</B>.
<P>
If only the <I>tag</I> argument is specified, this command looks for
an existing <I>tag</I> name and returns the commands associated
with it.  If there are no commands associated with <I>tag</I>,
this command returns the null string.
<P>
If no arguments are specified, this command returns a list of
all <I>tag</I> names previously registered.

<H3><A NAME="M5">EXAMPLE</A></H3>
Following is the <B>usual</B> declaration for the standard
Tk button widget:
<PRE>usual Button {
    keep -background -cursor -foreground -font
    keep -activebackground -activeforeground -disabledforeground
    keep -highlightcolor -highlightthickness
    rename -highlightbackground -background background Background
}</PRE>
Only the options that would be common to all buttons in a
single mega-widget are kept or renamed.  Options like &quot;-text&quot;
that would be unique to a particular button are ignored.
