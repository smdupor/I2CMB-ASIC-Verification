<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

<p /><a name="compatibility"></a><font size="4"><b>Compatibility Issues with Release 2020.4_1</b></font>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-65870 - (source) In some rare cases involving parameterized classes, a call to class::randomize() with an invalid argument that is not a field of the randomized class will not elicit an error during compile time. During simulation, the call with the illegal argument would also incorrectly be allowed to proceed without any error. The simulation time behavior has been changed to check and enforce the legality of arguments to class::randomize(). Any argument that is not a field of the randomized class will trigger a (vsim-7210) error. Note that this new error is suppressible, if the old (broken) behavior is desired.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-65052 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would avoid selecting specific valid solutions from the solution space when evaluating a randomization scenario involving array.sum() constraints. This issue has been fixed. </li>
 <li>QSIM-66481 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate constraints involving the queue-end expression ($) when specified within an iterative constraint. This issue has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source)  Fixed a bug where modifications to aliases were not affecting the original object.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source, results)  Refactored how -g / -G values are handled, now doing proper size checking to prevent unexpected errors where the value doesn't match the target object. Will now throw a warning if the value doesn't fit the constraints of the target object.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>VISU-18493 - (source, results) With 2020.3 onwards Symphony analog Vector support has been added in visualizer debug support. This will break the forward compatibility ( 2020.3 generated design.bin cannot be loaded from 2020.2 visualizer) whereas backward compatibility will remain intact (2020.2 generated design.bin can be loaded from 2020.3 visualizer)<br /></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-65779 - (source) Added suppressible error messages for the case where <i>uvm_hdl_check_path </i>returns FALSE in <i>-qfd</i> mode. This change may cause some existing customer testcases to give these error messages. They may be suppressed the messages using the vsim option <i>-suppress 16126</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="verilogdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2020.4_1</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-66870 - Vopt would generate an error like:<br /><br /><div>** Error: test.sv(51): Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error: ../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(99).<br /><br />When a derived class referenced the name of a class that is nested in the superclass.<br /></div> </li>
 <li>QSIM-64826 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would generate a solution violating a constraint involving an element of a virtual interface. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64538 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating a randset with the BDD solve engine. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64417 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would generate a solution violating an in-line constraint involving a local automatic variable. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64644 - In some rare cases, randomize() would encounter an internal error when evaluating scenarios involving random variables of packed struct type. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64586 - In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly interpret a 'unique' constraint within an if/else or 'soft' context as a non-conditional, 'hard' constraint. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64319 - In some rare cases, randomize() would generate a solution violating a constraint of the form &quot;!(rand_var inside { const_array })&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64316 - In some rare cases, a randomize() call would crash when evaluating a constraint involving a non-random unpacked array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64243 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger an internal error when evaluating a 'dist' constraint with values on the RHS that are outside of the domain of the target (LHS) type. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64160 - In some rare cases, during compilation, a package containing a randomize() call will trigger a spurious (vlog-2944) &quot;Illegal randomize() function call in random constraint&quot; error. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-64132 -  Vlog sometimes gave incorrect errors like:<br />** Error: while parsing file test.sv(50): Failed to find the name 'get_type' in scope 'tpkg'<br />For names like 'pkg::typename::get_type() where &quot;typename&quot; is a typedef name resolving to a class. <br /> </li>
 <li>QSIM-64922 -  Vlog reported the error:<br />** Error: test.sv(7) Illegal reference to an interface type C::Intf in implements clause.<br />In cases where &quot;C&quot; was a parameterized class type and 'Intf&quot; was a typedef name referenceing an interface class. </li>
 <li>QSIM-66018 - In some rare cases, randomize() would report a spurious (vsim-7090) error (Invalid X or Z in a state expression value within a constraint) when evaluating a function call in a constraint. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-65455 - In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a randomization scenario involving a negated &quot;inside&quot; constraint where a constant unpacked array appeared as an operand on the RHS (when the solution set contained valid solutions). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-65052 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would avoid selecting specific valid solutions from the solution space when evaluating a randomization scenario involving array.sum() constraints. This issue has been fixed. </li>
 <li>QSIM-64985 - Fixed an internal error in vopt that would occur in some cases involving a constraint expression containing a net (wire).</li>
 <li>QSIM-65623 - Fixed an issue which would cause randomize() to incorrectly evaluate constraints involving random variables that are/contain unpacked unions.</li>
 <li>QSIM-66481 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate constraints involving the queue-end expression ($) when specified within an iterative constraint. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-66347 - In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate constraints involving function calls to &quot;associative_array.num()&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-65870 - (source) In some rare cases involving parameterized classes, a call to class::randomize() with an invalid argument that is not a field of the randomized class will not elicit an error during compile time. During simulation, the call with the illegal argument would also incorrectly be allowed to proceed without any error. The simulation time behavior has been changed to check and enforce the legality of arguments to class::randomize(). Any argument that is not a field of the randomized class will trigger a (vsim-7210) error. Note that this new error is suppressible, if the old (broken) behavior is desired.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-65753 - Significantly improved the performance (simulation cpu time) of randomize() calls involving constraints with containing exponentiation expressions having a base value that is a power of 2.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 2020.4_1</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-64689 -  In some specific cases of detecting infinite loop in the rtl code, vsim used to crash. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60378 -  For some specific cases of vhdl packages containing unconstrained record subtypes compiled with mixedsvvh and being used in sv design. error should have come in the compilation as unconstrained record cannot be used in sv but we used to error out in vsim, This has been fixed   </li>
 <li>QSIM-67012 - Generic maps on subprogram instantiation declarations could associate non-object values with generics representing objects without emitting warning 1049. This warning is emitted in generic maps of all other instantiation forms, however. The compiler has been fixed to emit warnings when non-object values are associated with objects in generics maps of subprogram instantiation declarations.</li>
 <li>QSIM-66232 -  Fixed the crash in vsim by fixing an error in slicing of signal</li>
 <li>QSIM-63590 -  Vopt could crash if concatenation occur on an array type whose elements are unconstrained.  </li>
 <li>QSIM-65962 -  During compilation with the -autoorder and -quiet switches, if semantic errors were encountered during the refresh phase, the errors would not be printed. This behavior is incorrect, and now all errors are printed, though other compilation logging messages are suppressed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-66278 -  Large data structures that take over 2Gbytes of space would crash if default initialization is used. For this to happen the default value for all fields in the data structure must be 0 or NULL. Explicitly initializing the object will work around the issue.</li>
 <li>QSIM-65639 -  The design.bin could have incorrect bounds on signals. This occurs if the signal bounds depend on functions calls.  An these functions use the std.textio. </li>
 <li>QSIM-64242 -  For certain cases, string type variables inside functions used to retain values from previous call. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63680 -  In some case where vhdl files were compiled with different VHDL versions, some logical operations were producing an internal error. This has been fixed</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source)  Fixed a bug where modifications to aliases were not affecting the original object.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source, results)  Refactored how -g / -G values are handled, now doing proper size checking to prevent unexpected errors where the value doesn't match the target object. Will now throw a warning if the value doesn't fit the constraints of the target object.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="mixeddefects"></a><font size="4"><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 2020.4_1</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-60379 -  For some specific cases of  mixed language design where vhdl package containing record subtypes is compiled with mixedsvvh option and also being  used in sv, vsim used to give incorrect error. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="generalenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>General Enhancements in 2020.4_1</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-65779 - (source) Added suppressible error messages for the case where <i>uvm_hdl_check_path </i>returns FALSE in <i>-qfd</i> mode.

<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="systemverilogenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Enhancements in 2020.4_1</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-64441 - Implemented several enhancements to the RNG trace feature to improve usability for large testcases:<br /><ol><li>Filter out non-random class initialization operations from RNG trace output (enabled by default). Specify vsim command line option &quot;-rngtraceopt=+shownonrandclass&quot; to instruct RNG trace to preserve these operations.</li><li>Filter out set_randstate() calls that do not effectively change the randstate from RNG trace output (enabled by default). Specify vsim command line option &quot;-rngtraceopt=+showtrivialset&quot; to instruct RNG trace to preserve these operations.</li><li>Filter out thread initialization operations from RNG trace output (enabled by default). Specify vsim command line option &quot;-rngtraceopt=+showthreadinit&quot; to instruct RNG trace to preserve these operations.</li><li>To facilitate RNG analysis for testbenches that generate large RNG trace files:<br />- Specify &quot;-rngtraceskip=&lt;value&gt;&quot; to instruct RNG trace to skip recording the first &lt;value&gt; RNG operations in the trace file.<br />- Specify &quot;-rngtracemax=&lt;value&gt; to instruct RNG trace to stop recording after &lt;value&gt; operations have been written to the trace file.</li></ol></li>
 <li>QSIM-63337 - Improved the readability of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report generated by randomize() calls with no solutions. Constraints of the form &quot;my_var inside { random_array }&quot; are now printed as-is, instead of being printed as the expansion of the elements of &quot;random_array&quot;.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-63338 - Improved the readability of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report generated by randomize() calls with no solutions. Constraints involving constant variables now display the name of the constant variable (where possible) instead of an obfuscated name (such as &quot;#var#id&quot;) for -solvefaildebug=1 (previously, constant variable names were only preserved with -solvefaildebug=2).<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-63339 - Implemented a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;-svrandext=purecheck&quot;. When the &quot;purecheck&quot; extension is enabled, calls to class::randomize(null) will not invoke pre_randomize() and post_randomize() functions associated with the class on which randomize() is invoked. This extension is disabled by default.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62843 - Implemented a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;-svrandext=prerandfirst&quot;. When the &quot;prerandfirst&quot; extension is enabled, the pre_randomize() functions of rand dynamic array/queues of class handles will be executed prior to registering the constraints of the containing (parent) class (normal behavior is from the constraints of the parent class to be registered first). This extension is disabled by default.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64620 - Significantly improved the performance of some randomize() calls involving random dynamic arrays/queues that are not resized during randomization.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-64439 - Significantly improved the performance of some randomize() calls involving constraints that refer to non-random unpacked arrays.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-65542 - Significantly improved the performance (reduced simulation cpu time) and memory usage (reduced simulation peak memory usage) for randomize() calls evaluating solve/before constraints specifying a large number of high-prioirty and low-priority variables.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-64856 - Concatenation expressions with bit/part-selects are now supported within constrant contexts.</li>
