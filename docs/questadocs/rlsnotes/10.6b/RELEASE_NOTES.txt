   Release Announcements in 10.6b
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5
            x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release,
            gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for
            SystemC have been discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
            limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
          + (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
            deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
            deprecation process:
               o The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a
                 deprecation suppressible error message.
               o In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will
                 not be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with
                 error message.
               o Customer scripts using this switch will have to be
                 changed. This legacy switch forces incremental mode
                 (pre-6.0 behavior) which is sub-optimal, and it is no
                 longer maintained.
               o In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows
                 8.1 will be dropped.
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser
                 PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
                 documentation are fully functional.
                 Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
                 result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
                 current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the
                 PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all
                 web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of
                 this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals
                 is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
                 page-oriented layout.
                 Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate
                 between topics, and click links to examples, videos,
                 reference material, and other related technical content.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6b
       SystemVerilog Compatibility

     * dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or
       multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify
       block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.
     * dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to
       X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM.
     * dvt96725 - (results) A protected object cannot have its value
       reported using VPI.
     * dvt99392 - (results) Unnamed generate block in a protected region
       would not have its name changed to when it was involved in the
       output from a %m format specifier. This has been fixed.
     * dvt98590 - (results) Force -deposit with multi dimensional indexing
       on force target was not supported. This works now.
     * dvt96138 - (results) Real values passed to a wire port used to
       report junk values, if read as it is. This is now fixed and the
       real value is now rounded of to nearest integer and then passed on
       to integer type port. Earlier, Questa used to support real values
       passed to port to be interpreted through $bitstoreal. This behavior
       is not supported anymore. For such a case to work, real values
       should first be converted to equivalent bits using $realtobits and
       then bits received at port should be read back using $bitstoreal.
     * dvt88967 - (results) Forcing a bit-select or part-select of a
       variable with non-constant index used to report an error. With this
       support, questa will report a warning instead of an error. Further,
       changes in the index of a select will not trigger changes in force
       and only the initial value of index will be picked.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt98805 - (source) In case, case generate, selected signal
       assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error
       was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For
       example "CASE s'RANGE" would not result in an syntax error. It was
       either treated as length of the range or an internal error was
       reported from vcom or vopt.
     * dvt97035 - (results) In some cases, assignment statement within a
       for loop would have their line number changed to something else.
       This would result in incorrect coverage information being
       generated. Stepping through the loop would case the source display
       to jump to an incorrect line.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch
       was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s)
       '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit
       specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain
       a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line
       character.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt80013 - (results) The Expression Coverage report has been
       enhanced to identify the non-testable terms of the expression by
       showing "Not Testable" in their non-masking conditions and to mark
       such terms excluded. If any of the implicant or alternate of a
       ternary expression is 'X' (or 'Z'), the input terms used in the
       condition of ternary expression are treated 'not testable'. Also,
       when any input term in a logical or bitwise expression is fixed to
       its masking state, the terms in the expression become 'not
       testable'. Since these terms do not contribute to the coverage of
       the expression, they are now marked excluded from the report. This
       ensures correct calculation of coverage percentage and also makes
       the report more intuitive.
     * dvt91786 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to
       cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose
       resulting output is still single bit.
       For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] &&
       in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as
       single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded
       as a single term for coverage.
       To enable the feature, -coverFecSingleTerm switch (in addition to
       other coverage switches) is needed in vopt.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
       ___________________________________________________________________

       General Defects Repaired in 10.6b

     * dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch
       was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s)
       '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit
       specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain
       a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line
       character.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6b
     * dvt97421 - The "compare annotate" command returns an error as
       undefined, which is incorrect. The "compare" command help suggests
       "annotation", which is incorrect. This problem has been solved,
       "compare annotate" works, and the help text has been corrected.
     * dvt97551 - Control+mouse wheel zooming in the Wave window would
       incorrectly also scroll the view vertically. This problem has been
       fixed, as well as other minor inconsistencies with mouse wheel
       scrolling.
     * dvt83149 - The Wave window analog display will correctly use user
       defined fixed radix types when computing and displaying the analog
       real or integer values.
     * dvt98713 - The "Start Simulation" dialog box failed to include the
       -coverage option when selected on the "Others" tab. This issue has
       been resolved.
     * dvt98987 - With the Process window open and in Hierarchy mode, the
       context ends up at the wrong process. Consequently, any inspection
       of call stack for values is wrong or fails to work at all. This can
       happen when one of the active process's parent threads has
       terminated. When this is the case, the Process window will now
       switch to "Active" mode in order to correctly display the current
       selected active process.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6b
     * dvt96162 - Simulation mismatch with different full optimization
       when using delayed clocking Blocks.
     * dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or
       multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify
       block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.
     * dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to
       X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM.
     * dvt96725 - (results) A protected object cannot have its value
       reported using VPI.
     * dvt99392 - (results) Unnamed generate block in a protected region
       would not have its name changed to when it was involved in the
       output from a %m format specifier. This has been fixed.
     * dvt99439 - Fixed a vsim crash when a copy of class object is
       created inside another parameterized class say class B. And this
       class B or any of its super class extends the its own type
       parameter.
     * dvt99227 - Fixed a vopt crash when concatenation expression is used
       in the let statement. The concatenation expression contain the
       external declaration and let is in class task.
     * dvt98818 - Fixed a vsim crash when a real number is displayed as
       integer.
     * dvt98214 - If a signal 'say reg r' is updated with #0.xxx delay in
       a initial block which rounded to #0 delay and there is also an
       always block on r. Then the always block will also be executed with
       change in r.
     * dvt97683 - Fixed an invalid vsim-8304 when passing struct element
       to function ref argument through class virtual interface.
     * dvt97692 - Fixed a vopt crash when replication constant is
       calculated through some constant function with structure as
       argument.
     * dvt96735 - Fixed an invalid circular dependency error when value of
       a parameter in interface is calculated through constant function
       with argument as structure member.
     * dvt98834 - wreal nets were not being treated as a real type within
       certain expressions, leading to an "operator invalid for REAL"
       message being issued by the compiler.
     * dvt99463 - Fixed memory leak when forces on optimized cell ports
       are present.
     * dvt98590 - (results) Force -deposit with multi dimensional indexing
       on force target was not supported. This works now.
     * dvt96138 - (results) Real values passed to a wire port used to
       report junk values, if read as it is. This is now fixed and the
       real value is now rounded of to nearest integer and then passed on
       to integer type port. Earlier, Questa used to support real values
       passed to port to be interpreted through $bitstoreal. This behavior
       is not supported anymore. For such a case to work, real values
       should first be converted to equivalent bits using $realtobits and
       then bits received at port should be read back using $bitstoreal.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6b
     * dvt97035 - (results) In some cases, assignment statement within a
       for loop would have their line number changed to something else.
       This would result in incorrect coverage information being
       generated. Stepping through the loop would case the source display
       to jump to an incorrect line.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.
     * dvt97593 - Direct instantiation of an entity with a package
       instantiation in one of the generic map associations could cause
       incorrect code to be generated by the compiler, possibly leading to
       a loading failure message from the simulator.
     * dvt98805 - (source) In case, case generate, selected signal
       assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error
       was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For
       example "CASE s'RANGE" would not result in an syntax error. It was
       either treated as length of the range or an internal error was
       reported from vcom or vopt.
     * dvt99166 - Writing a STRING to the FILE STD.TEXTIO.OUTPUT (which is
       stdout) using the function STD.TEXTIO.WRITE[TEXT,STRING] could
       result in a crash if the string contained two terminating LF (0x0a)
       characters.
     * dvt99443 - Record aggregate with OTHERS could result in a vcom or
       vopt crash if the expression was not of the same subtype as the
       record element(s) being associated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.6b
     * dvt99466 - While trying to print the vsim-6577 error, for a
       sc_module, sc_port or a sc_prim_channel global or static SystemC
       object that is being destroyed at exit time, vsim might crash in
       some odd scenarios. This issue is now fixed. vsim will report a
       vsim-6522 warning instead and exit gracefully.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.6b
     * dvt97305 - vcom gave error when '#' in used in VHDL code and is
       compiled with a pslfile vunit file.
     * dvt97896 - Some assertions clocked by a bit-select of a variable
       woke up even when that bit of the variable is not changing.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.6b
     * dvt85944 - While using -msglimit or -msglimitcount option,
       specified messages were suppressed silently after reaching the
       given limit. User will now see a note when limit is reached and
       specified message will no longer be printed.
** Note: (vsim-189) Message ID '8259' has reached the reporting limit of '4'. Th
is message will be suppressed now onwards.

     * dvt79741 - When the performance profiler collects a sample in code
       not associated with an instance of the design it is reported in the
       structural report as "NoContext". Some samples previously reported
       in "NoContext" are now reported as "AdvanceTime". These samples
       represent time spent in the simulation kernel switching to the next
       timing region, advancing delta time, or simulation time.
     * dvt79741 - When the performance profiler collects a sample in code
       not associated with an instance of the design it is reported in the
       structural report at "NoContext". Some samples previously reported
       as "NoContext" are not reported as "NetActivity" and
       "ProcessActivity". Samples reported in "NetActivity" indicate
       simulator time updating and propagating net values for nets that do
       not retain their identity. Samples reported in "ProcessActivity"
       indicate simulator time executing processes that do not retain
       their identity. The identity of a net or process is not retained if
       the identity it not needed for simulation. For example, if the net
       is not logged.

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.6b
     * dvt98281 - A preference option has been added to turn off the radix
       base display within the waveform view only while still showing the
       radix base in the value column. This new option can be found in the
       Wave Preference dialog box.
     * dvt99074 - A preference setting has been added to disable export of
       the Primary selection from the Structure and Objects windows. The
       preference variable is PrefMain(exportTreeSelection). An "on"
       (default) value makes the selected item available as the Primary
       selection and can be pasted into other windows and applications. An
       "off" will disable the export. Explicit copy operations will
       continue to be supported in both modes.

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6b
     * dvt96548 - Allowed the parameter reference through virtual
       interface in part-select expression with -svext=aptviinexpr in
       vsim.
     * dvt96093 - Complex constant functions sometimes caused slow
       performance in vlog and vopt.
     * dvt98467 - Added a SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension to consider all fields of an unpacked struct as 'rand',
       regardless of whether an explicit 'rand' attribute is specified for
       the field or not. This extension is disabled by default. Enable
       this extension using the vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=+randstruct".
     * [nodvtid] - Parenthesis around a specify terminal descriptor are
       now recognized as an LRM extension. The SV parser will now accept
       parens when the error message 13290 is either suppressed or demoted
       to a warning.
     * dvt62583 - Added a SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension which implements a non-LRM compliant form of 'rand_mode'
       for random unpacked arrays (fixed, dynamic, queues, associative).
       When this extension is enabled, every random unpacked array will
       keep track of its 'rand_mode' value independently of the
       'rand_mode' values of its elements. This extension is disabled by
       default. Enable this extension using vlog/vopt command line option
       "-svext=+arraymode" *and* the vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=+arraymode".
     * dvt88967 - (results) Forcing a bit-select or part-select of a
       variable with non-constant index used to report an error. With this
       support, questa will report a warning instead of an error. Further,
       changes in the index of a select will not trigger changes in force
       and only the initial value of index will be picked.

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.6b
     * [nodvtid] - The UDP Coverage Support will be removed in future
       releases as it is not a recommended coverage collection metric. The
       following deprecation warning message will appear when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected from 10.6a onwards, "UDP Expression Coverage
       is not a recommended Coverage Collection Metrics. It will be
       deprecated in Future releases."
     * dvt80013 - (results) The Expression Coverage report has been
       enhanced to identify the non-testable terms of the expression by
       showing "Not Testable" in their non-masking conditions and to mark
       such terms excluded. If any of the implicant or alternate of a
       ternary expression is 'X' (or 'Z'), the input terms used in the
       condition of ternary expression are treated 'not testable'. Also,
       when any input term in a logical or bitwise expression is fixed to
       its masking state, the terms in the expression become 'not
       testable'. Since these terms do not contribute to the coverage of
       the expression, they are now marked excluded from the report. This
       ensures correct calculation of coverage percentage and also makes
       the report more intuitive.
     * dvt91786 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to
       cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose
       resulting output is still single bit.
       For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] &&
       in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as
       single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded
       as a single term for coverage.
       To enable the feature, -coverFecSingleTerm switch (in addition to
       other coverage switches) is needed in vopt.
     * dvt98288 - Added scref argument in vlog -svext option to allow
       specifying ref arguments in covergroup sample functions without
       using const.
     * [nodvtid] - The UDP Coverage Support will be removed in future
       releases as it is not a recommended coverage collection metric. The
       following deprecation warning message will appear when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected from 10.6b onwards, "UDP expression coverage
       has been deprecated in 10.6. It will no longer be supported in
       future releases (10.7 onwards)."

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.6b
     * dvt97428 - Following enhancements have been made in 'power on reset
       assertion': Non-Retention Register Reset : Current Implementation:
       (vopt -pa_checks=npu): Checks that non-retention registers are
       reset when the power domain containing them is powered up. Sample
       error message: ** Error: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 12 ns,
       Asynchronous (set/reset) control for the following flop(s) of power
       domain 'PD1' is not asserted at power up: # /tb/top_inst/out1. #
       File: test.upf, Line: 4, Power Domain:PD1 Updated Implementation:
       User can specify following 2 design attributes to add timing
       control in 'power on reset' assertion: set_design_attributes
       -attribute qpa_attr_inactive_reset_duration Tmax
       set_design_attributes -attribute qpa_attr_active_reset_duration
       Twidth If these attributes are defined, then 'Power on reset'
       assertions shall be defined as following: QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: (vopt
       -pa_checks=npu) : 1) Checks that Asynchronous Reset must be
       asserted within Tmax time units after power-up. 2) Checks that
       Asynchronous Reset must not be deasserted before Twidth time units
       after getting asserted. Sample Error Messages: # ** Error:
       (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 16 ns, Asynchronous(set/reset)
       control for the following flop(s) in scope '/tb/top_inst' of power
       domain 'PD0' is not asserted within 4 time-units after power up: #
       out2, # out[0], # out[1], # File: ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line: 4,
       Power Domain:PD0 # ** Note: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 19
       ns, Asynchronous(set/reset) control for the following flop(s) in
       scope '/tb/top_inst' of power domain 'PD0' is deasserted within 3
       time-units after getting asserted: # out1, # out5. # File:
       ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line: 4, Power Domain:PD0 If these
       attributes are not defined, we fall back to original behavior.
     * dvt97427 - All Low power messages can be redirected to a specified
       file (in stead of default transcript) by means of vsim option
       -pa_logfile
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Enhancements in 10.6b
     * dvt94883 - In post-sim mode (vsim -view), The 'Cover Directives'
       window is now populated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   MC2 Enhancements in 10.6b
     * dvt98025 - In some scenarios, user may need to pass additional vlog
       options to mc2com's interface file compilation. User can now pass
       all such options through -mc2vlogargs in mc2com.
  -mc2vlogargs  Specify vlog options for MC2 interface file compilation.
