There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>
 <li>(source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be deprecated in the next major 
release 10.7 following normal deprecation process:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
suppressible error message.
<li>In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not be 
accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error message.
<li>Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed. 
This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior) which 
is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.</li>
 <li>In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows 8.1 will be dropped. </li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

<ul><li>dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.</li>
 <li>dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM. </li>
 <li>dvt96725 - (results) A protected object cannot have its value reported using VPI.
</li>
 <li>dvt99392 - (results) Unnamed generate block in a protected region would not have its name changed to <protected> when it was involved in the output from a %m format specifier.  This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt98590 - (results) Force -deposit with multi dimensional indexing on force target was not supported. This works now.</li>
 <li>dvt96138 - (results) Real values passed to a wire port used to report junk values, if read as it is. This is now fixed and the real value is now rounded of to nearest integer and then passed on to integer type port. Earlier, Questa used to support real values passed to port to be interpreted through $bitstoreal. This behavior is not supported anymore. For such a case to work, real values should first be converted to equivalent bits using $realtobits and then bits received at port should be read back using $bitstoreal.</li>
 <li>dvt88967 - (results) Forcing a bit-select or part-select of a variable with non-constant index used to report an error. With this support, questa will report a warning instead of an error. Further, changes in the index of a select will not trigger changes in force and only the initial value of index will be picked.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt98805 - (source) In  case, case generate, selected signal assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For example "CASE s'RANGE"  would not result in an syntax error. It was either treated as length of the range or an internal error was reported from vcom or vopt.</li>
 <li>dvt97035 - (results) In some cases, assignment statement within a for loop would have their line number changed to something else.  This would result in incorrect coverage information being generated. Stepping through the loop would case the source display to jump to an incorrect line.</li>
 <li>dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s) '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line character.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt80013 - (results) The Expression Coverage report has been enhanced to identify the non-testable terms of the expression by showing "Not Testable" in their non-masking conditions and to mark such terms excluded.
If any of the implicant or alternate of a ternary expression is 'X' (or 'Z'), the input terms used in the condition of ternary expression are treated 'not testable'. Also, when any input term in a logical or bitwise expression is fixed to its masking state, the terms in the expression become 'not testable'. Since these terms do not contribute to the coverage of the expression, they are now marked excluded from the report. This ensures correct calculation of coverage percentage and also makes the report more intuitive.</li>
 <li>dvt91786 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose resulting output is still single bit.
<br>
For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] && in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded as a single term for coverage.
<br>
To enable the feature, -coverFecSingleTerm switch (in addition to other coverage switches) is needed in vopt. 
<br></li>

<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6b</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt97421 - The "compare annotate" command returns an error as undefined, which is incorrect.  The "compare" command help suggests "annotation", which is incorrect.  This problem has been solved, "compare annotate" works, and the help text has been corrected.</li>
 <li>dvt97551 - Control+mouse wheel zooming in the Wave window would incorrectly also scroll the view vertically.  This problem has been fixed, as well as other minor inconsistencies with mouse wheel scrolling.</li>
 <li>dvt83149 - The Wave window analog display will correctly use user defined fixed radix types when computing and displaying the analog real or integer values.</li>
 <li>dvt98713 - The "Start Simulation" dialog box failed to include the -coverage option when selected on the "Others" tab.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt98987 - With the Process window open and in Hierarchy mode, the context ends up at the wrong process.  Consequently, any inspection of call stack for values is wrong or fails to work at all.  This can happen when one of the active process's parent threads has terminated.  When this is the case, the Process window will now switch to "Active" mode in order to correctly display the current selected active process.</li>

 <li>dvt99439 - Fixed a vsim crash when a copy of class object is created inside another parameterized class say class B. And this class B or any of its super class extends the its own type parameter.</li>
 <li>dvt99227 - Fixed a vopt crash when concatenation expression is used in the let statement. The concatenation expression contain the external declaration and let is in class task. </li>
 <li>dvt98818 - Fixed a vsim crash when a real number is displayed as integer.</li>
 <li>dvt98214 - If a signal 'say reg r' is updated with #0.xxx delay in a initial block which rounded to #0 delay and there is also an always block on r. Then the always block will also be executed with change in r.</li>
 <li>dvt97683 - Fixed an invalid vsim-8304 when passing struct element to function ref argument through class virtual interface.</li>
 <li>dvt97692 - Fixed a vopt crash when replication constant is calculated through some constant function with structure as argument.</li>
 <li>dvt96735 - Fixed an invalid circular dependency error when value of a parameter in interface is calculated through constant function with argument as structure member.</li>
 <li>dvt98834 - wreal nets were not being treated as a real type within certain expressions, leading to an "operator invalid for REAL" message being issued by the compiler.</li>
 <li>dvt99463 - Fixed memory leak when forces on optimized cell ports are present.</li>
 <li>dvt98590 - (results) Force -deposit with multi dimensional indexing on force target was not supported. This works now.</li>

 <li>dvt79741 - When the performance profiler collects a sample in code not associated with an instance of the design it is reported in the structural report as "NoContext". Some samples previously reported in "NoContext" are now reported as "AdvanceTime". These samples represent time spent in the simulation kernel switching to the next timing region, advancing delta time, or simulation time. </li>
 <li>dvt79741 - When the performance profiler collects a sample in code not associated with an instance of the design it is reported in the structural report at "NoContext". Some samples previously reported as "NoContext" are not reported as "NetActivity" and "ProcessActivity". Samples reported in "NetActivity" indicate simulator time updating and propagating net values for nets that do not retain their identity. Samples reported in "ProcessActivity" indicate simulator time executing processes that do not retain their identity. The identity of a net or process is not retained if the identity it not needed for simulation. For example, if the net is not logged.</li>

** Error: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 12 ns, Asynchronous (set/reset) control for the following flop(s) of power domain 'PD1' is not asserted at power up:
# /tb/top_inst/out1.
# File: test.upf, Line: 4, Power Domain:PD1

Updated Implementation:

 

User can specify following 2 design attributes to add timing control in 'power on reset' assertion:

set_design_attributes -attribute qpa_attr_inactive_reset_duration Tmax
set_design_attributes -attribute qpa_attr_active_reset_duration Twidth

If these attributes are defined, then 'Power on reset' assertions shall be defined as following:

QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF:       (vopt -pa_checks=npu)  : 
1)      Checks that Asynchronous Reset must be asserted within Tmax time units after power-up.
2)      Checks that Asynchronous Reset must not be deasserted before Twidth time units after getting asserted.

Sample Error Messages:
# ** Error: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 16 ns,  Asynchronous(set/reset) control for the following flop(s) in scope '/tb/top_inst' of power domain 'PD0' is not asserted within 4 time-units after power up:
# out2,
# out[0],
# out[1],
# File: ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line:           4, Power Domain:PD0

# ** Note: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 19 ns,  Asynchronous(set/reset) control for the following flop(s) in scope '/tb/top_inst' of power domain 'PD0' is deasserted within 3 time-units after getting asserted:
# out1,
# out5.
# File: ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line:           4, Power Domain:PD0

If these attributes are not defined, we fall back to original behavior.
