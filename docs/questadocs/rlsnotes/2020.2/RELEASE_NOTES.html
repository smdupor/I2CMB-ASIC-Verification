<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-62044 - (results) Change ternary operator with X condition and non-matching real operands to evaluate to 0.0 as specified by the LRM.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60936 - (results)  When iterating through the systf parameters with vpi, when a parameter was encountered that was a protected object, and error message was issued, NULL was returned, and the iterator was destroyed.  This was wrong as per 2012 LRM, 37.40, detail #10:<div><br /></div><div>10) System task and function calls that are protected shall allow iteration over the vpiArgument relationship.</div><div><br /></div><div>This had been fixed.</div><div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-60936 - (results)  Forcing protected objects in vpi in prior Questa releases was allowed, despite non-compliance with the LRM.  Now, vpi forcing of protected objects.  Is NOT allowed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60936 - (results)  vpi forcing of protected objects resulted in a write access error.  This was changed to be more specific; a protected access error.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62161 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate a constraint involving a dist/inside/unique construct with an indexed multi-dimensional array (where the index is random) on the RHS. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62298 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution when evaluating a constraint involving a dist/inside/unique where the RHS is a non-random unpacked array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62229 - (results) In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate iterative (foreach) constraints on multi-dimensional arrays, where one or more array dimensions are dynamic, if the array is specified using non-LRM compliant syntax (e.g. &quot;foreach(a[0][i])&quot;). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-61574 - (results)  Removed the environment variable &quot;MTI_USE_DECL_PORT_VAR&quot; that is used to turn ports into wires when it is compatiable for non-ANSI port list. Now this functionality is achieved using -svinputport=compat for ANSI and non-ANSI port lists.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60165 - (results) The output of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report has been improved when outputting information about variables/constraints involving packed structs. In the past, individual fields of packed structs were displayed as part-selects by the constraint contradiction report. The report now displays these as field names (where possible) improving the readability of the report.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-61007 - (results)  It is not legal to connect ports in a port map with sub-element association to OPEN, even if all sub-elements are OPEN. This enhancement allows for unconstrained ports to be associated with sub-elements as long as all sub-elements associated to OPEN.<br />This is to allow the unconstrained port to be given a constraint. Statements like<br /><blockquote>PORT MAP( OUT(1) =&gt; OPEN) -- Constrains out to (1 to 1)<br />PORT MAP( OUT(1 to 2) =&gt; OPEN) -- Constrains out to ( 1 to 2)<br /></blockquote>Note that the direction of the unconstrained port is the direction of the index range subtype and is usually TO not DOWNTO. <br /><blockquote> </blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>VISU-18661 - (source, results)  With 2020.2 onwards Verilog-AMS event argument list has been supported for debug purposes, This will break the forward compatibility (2020.2 generated design.bin can not be loaded from 2020.1 visualizer) where as backward compatibility will be intact (2020.1 generated design.bin can be loaded from 2020.2 visualizer).</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Modified VRM to truncate coverage numbers (as opposed to rounding) in order to match the other coverage reporting tools.<br /></li>

 <li>QSIM-62470 -  In some rare cases, a randomize() call with an in-line constraint that references a static class field would cause vopt to crash. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62421 - In some rare cases, many repeated calls to randomize() on a class with a 'rand' class field that toggles between NULL and non-NULL would cause vsim to crash. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62298 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution when evaluating a constraint involving a dist/inside/unique where the RHS is a non-random unpacked array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62271 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause vsim to crash when evaluating a constraint involving a dist/inside/unique where the RHS is a non-random unpacked array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62382 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger a spurious error (vsim-7066: Index out of bounds) when evaluating constraints involving indexed arrays. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62229 - (results) In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate iterative (foreach) constraints on multi-dimensional arrays, where one or more array dimensions are dynamic, if the array is specified using non-LRM compliant syntax (e.g. &quot;foreach(a[0][i])&quot;). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62312 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause vsim to crash when evaluating a constraint involving an associative array with a random index. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  -  Vsim could sometimes give this error when declaring an out-of-body class function where the return type referenced another parameterized class using &quot;classname::&quot;<br /><blockquote>Error: foo.sv(12): Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error: ../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(225).

 <li>QSIM-61574 - (results)  Removed the environment variable &quot;MTI_USE_DECL_PORT_VAR&quot; that is used to turn ports into wires when it is compatiable for non-ANSI port list. Now this functionality is achieved using -svinputport=compat for ANSI and non-ANSI port lists.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62117 -  In some rare cases, an internal error would occur when randomize() is evaluating a 'dist' constraint with a non-random LHS. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-62480 - Significantly improved performance for some randomize() calls involving if/else constraints where the implicate (condition is true) and alternate (condition is false) constraints are equivalent (but not identical). </li>
 <li>QSIM-62633 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would select an invalid solution for a scenario involving a '!inside' constraint where a non-random unpacked array is specified on the RHS of the 'inside' operator. This issue has been fixed.</li>

 <li>QSIM-56666 -  In certain cases when connecting a vhdl signal by ('0) at system verilog side, an incorrect error was reported. this has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60929 -  For some specific cases when &quot;-error 1246&quot; option is specified in vcom or vopt options. Vopt used to give null range error incorrectly for standard libraries. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59832 -  For some specific cases of vsim restart flow, vsim use to crash. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59718 -  For some specific cases of nested vhdl packages compiled with -mixedsvvh, vcom use to crash . This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62149 - Using VHDL-2008, vopt would crash if an array of whose element subtype is not fully constrained is sliced.  This would occur if the value of the slice is needed for elaboration.<br /> </li>
 <li>QSIM-61842 -  For some specific cases of load elab flow when combined with restart flow , Vsim used to crash. This has been fixed</li>
 <li>QSIM-62768 -  When using the -skip or -just option, comments that are followed by an empty line, would cause vcom to start processing a design unit's source early.  This could result in compile time errors.</li>
