   Key Information
     * dvt73631 - (results) VHDL 2008 users who use generic packages or
       subprograms must refresh the associated design units or recompile
       from source code with this release. Changes made for correctness
       affect internal data structures and are incompatible with vhdl-2008
       design units generated with earlier releases.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Release Announcements in 10.3e
     * [nodvtid] -
       In the next major release (10.4), support for Windows XP and
       Windows Vista will be discontinued.
       [10.3e] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.3e.
       However if you are migrating to 10.3e from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs
       that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.3e.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.3e

   Key Information Compatibility
     * dvt73631 - (results) VHDL 2008 users who use generic packages or
       subprograms must refresh the associated design units or recompile
       from source code with this release. Changes made for correctness
       affect internal data structures and are incompatible with vhdl-2008
       design units generated with earlier releases.

   User Interface Compatibility
     * dvt71982 - (results) Individual 2-state SV struct field values
       could be shown incorrectly in the Objects window. This has been
       corrected.
     * dvt70169 - (results) Logging a System Verilog interface port would
       result in the actual interface being logged, but not the port. The
       fix ensures that the port AND the actual interface are logged so
       that post-simulation viewing of the WLF file will contain both the
       port and the actual interface. NOTE: This required a WLF file
       version change. This makes WLF files written with this version of
       Modelsim/Questa incompatible and unreadable by older version of
       Modelsim/Questa.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A new feature called VHDL Access Path
       Expressions has been introduced which provides improved visibility
       and a more intuitive way of viewing VHDL access variables and
       objects in the Wave Window. Some of the features of vhdl access
       path expressions are:
          + More descriptive pointer values. Values are Dynamic Object
            Identifiers instead of hexadecimal memory address.
          + Access references may be expanded in place in the wave window
            rather than having to inspect individual access objects one by
            one.
          + Ability to add access_var.all to see dereferenced object
            values.
          + Ability to "cast" unconstrained arrays to constrained array
            type.
          + The [accessinfo] command gives metrix and reports about access
            object usage.
          + Enabled with -accessobjdebug switch or AccessObjDebug
            modelsim.ini variable setting.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt71429 - (results) Using a streaming concat inside a regular
       vector concat could result in vsim crashing or getting the wrong
       value.
     * dvt71985 - (results) Taking a slice of an unpacked net array could
       produce the wrong value under some circumstances.
     * dvt72057 - (results) For large designs with a common clock driving
       more than 2 million udp instances, udp sensitivity to the clock may
       be lost.
     * dvt72134 - (results) Registers feeding into a primitive that drives
       an output of a full timing optimized cell could provide incorrect
       results.
     * dvt71528 - (results) Optimized gate-level cells with path delays
       specified in the HDL with large values, could result in zero delay
       propagation delays.
     * dvt72442 - (results) Fix vopt assertion fatal error.
     * dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values
       were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values,
       vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.
     * dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port
       driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays
       and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and
       -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.
     * dvt73542 - (results) Gate-level optimized cells with cascading
       sequential udps may under some conditions not evaluate correctly.
     * dvt74257 - (results) Using the associative array method 'exists'
       with a wildcard array inside a parameterized class, or through an
       external reference, could result in an incorrect 'false' result.
     * dvt71774 - (results) A simulation invoked with an elab or a
       checkpoint file from 3-step flow (with SDF file specified to vopt),
       would not reload SDF on "restart -f".

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an
       uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either
       through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer
       designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing
       symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to
       either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of
       the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.
     * dvt71619 - (results) On 64 bits, array shift and rotate operations
       whose second operand ( shift/rotate amount) is INTEGER'LEFT would
       generate a stack overflow error. This has been fixed and the result
       when the shift/rotate amount is INTEGER'LEFT on both 64 and 32 bit
       has been changed to generate the correct value.

   SVA/PSL Compatibility
     * dvt71348 - (results) vsim gave unresolved reference error when
       there when an assertion referenced a property hierachically. With
       this fix we will now give an error for unresolved paths in a
       property/sequence even if this property/sequence was not
       instantiated in the design.
     * dvt74394 - (results) When SVA accept_on/sync_accept_on expression
       is true it will result in real passes (instead of vacuous passes).
       Pass action blocks are rare but if an assertion using these
       properties has a pass action block then this action block will be
       triggered with this change.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * dvt72760 - (results) In a mixed language design with a verilog
       switch network the extended VCD output for a VHDL signal was not
       calculated properly.

   General Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) There is a change in the meaning of "recursion
       level" specified to various vopt options like
       +acc/+noacc/+cover/+nocover/+initreg/+initmem. Before, this level
       meant how many levels under the current level, the option is to be
       applied. So, level 0 meant no recursion. Now, 0 recursion level
       means full recursion. And this option means how many levels
       including the current level, the option is to be applied.
       The following change in the recursion level keeps the options
       behaving the same way as before.
       previous: +acc=r+/top/r now: +acc=r+/top/r (no change)
       previous: +acc+/top. now: +acc+/top. (no change)
       previous: +acc+top+128 now: +acc+top+0 (full recursion)
       previous: +initreg+0+/top/du+0 now: +initreg+0+/top/du+1 (level ->
       level + 1)
       previous: +cover+lib1.du+2 now: +cover+lib1.du+3 (level -> level +
       1)

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt74716 - (results)
The assert scope requires some special case processing to compute "total coverag
e" for an assertion:
    If an assertion has both pass and fail counts
        It is 100% if pass count > 0 and fail count == 0
    else if it has only fail count:
        It is 100% if fail count == 0

The UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST element of the summary record represents this perce
ntage.

The ranktest tool will use and report the 'UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST' metric (whe
n possible). If there is any assertion failure in any test, it is a bug/problem
that must be addressed by the user.

Until ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will use the "%success metric" like the rest of our reporting tools
.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will agree with the "total coverage" nu
mber our reporting tools.
 3. The "%success" metric will be reported in the "Assertions" column.

After ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will ignore the "%success" metric in its calculations.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will NOT agree with the "total coverage
" number our reporting tools.
 3. A "-" will be reported in the "Assertions" column.
 4. A warning message similar to the following will be issued:

** Warning: (vcover-17208) One or more tests contain "assertion failures".
Ranktest will not include "assertion successes" in its ranking metric
calculations (i.e. "assertion successes" will be weighted as 0).

As a consequence, the ranking total coverage metric may be different from the to
tal coverage numbers of other Questa GUI and CLI tools. The reason for this alte
ration is that the "%success" metric is now exhibiting a NON-monotonically incre
asing behavior and can no longer be used in the ranktest "greedy" algorithm. Ran
ktest will NOT use the "assertion pass" metric in any way (neither with nor with
out assertion failures).

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs
       that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.3e.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt67937 - -assertfile/-errorfile switches did not work with
       -load_elab switch.
     * dvt70157 - Restored vmake's behavior for VHDL design units to
       better deal with building incrementally and use of vcom's "-f"
       switch.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt63858 - Toggling the "Within Cells" mode of the Memory List
       window while a search filter is in use can cause the display of an
       incomplete list of memories. This issues has been resolved.
     * dvt71982 - (results) Individual 2-state SV struct field values
       could be shown incorrectly in the Objects window. This has been
       corrected.
     * dvt64155 - Two new radixes have been implemented, sfixed and ufixed
       (signed fixed and unsigned fixed, respectively.) Values may be
       displayed using these radixes, for example, [examine -radix ufixed
       var] might produce the value 1.375. The criteria for displaying an
       object as sfixed or ufixed is that the type of the object must be
       an array of std_ulogic elements between 2 and 64 bits long with a
       descending range. (The set of supported types may increase in the
       future.) The binary point for the value is implicitly located
       between the 0th and -1st elements of the array. The index range for
       the type need not include 0 or -1, for example (-4 downto -8) in
       which case the value will be extended for conversion, as
       appropriate. If the type does not meet these criteria the value
       will be displayed as decimal or unsigned, respectively. The radix
       command, global radix dialog and wave window radix menus support
       these radixes.
     * dvt71287 - The "Fixed Point Radix" dialog box was missing the radix
       "decimal" as a possible base type. This has been corrected. Decimal
       is now the default base selection in the dialog.
     * dvt74014 - A malformed [add wave] command can cause the UI to
       crash.
     * dvt74038 - A user defined keyboard short-cut bound to the
       Simulate->Step->Step commands, or any other global menu operations
       do not work. This has been resolved.
     * dvt74187 - The wrong instance scope will sometimes be used when
       displaying a signals declaration in the Source window from the Wave
       window.
     * dvt74126 - In Questa, the "change" command could crash or
       incorrectly ignore ".super" psuedo scope. This has been corrected.
     * dvt29745 - Using the Library window popup menu to invoke Simulate
       (start a simulation) will sometimes produce an error message and
       fail to launch the simulation. This occurs after performing a
       design optimization from the Library window.
     * dvt74813 - Mouse Middle Button zoom-out stroke does not work in
       Wave window when the waveform view starts at 0.
     * dvt70169 - (results) Logging a System Verilog interface port would
       result in the actual interface being logged, but not the port. The
       fix ensures that the port AND the actual interface are logged so
       that post-simulation viewing of the WLF file will contain both the
       port and the actual interface. NOTE: This required a WLF file
       version change. This makes WLF files written with this version of
       Modelsim/Questa incompatible and unreadable by older version of
       Modelsim/Questa.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt69512 - A function call in one of the bounds of a part-select
       produced the following vopt internal error in some cases: "Questa
       has encountered an unexpected internal error:
       ../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(114)".
     * dvt71073 - Automatic function defined in package would sometimes
       gives incorrect return value. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt70882 - A bit-select of a hierarchical reference connected to a
       module input port produced incorrect results in some cases if the
       bit-select index also contained a hierarchical reference.
     * dvt71294 - Fixed a bug where a part select expression involving
       multi-dimensional array having index of multi-dimensional array of
       type byte (or bit [7:0]) is used. Example :- int_out_data[15:00] =
       m_item_h.m_mux_in[sel_line][15:0]; where sel_line is of type
       bit[7:0]
     * dvt71429 - (results) Using a streaming concat inside a regular
       vector concat could result in vsim crashing or getting the wrong
       value.
     * dvt71701 - A 'defparam' inside a generate clause in a mixed
       Verilog/VHDL design could cause an erroneous error 10000.
     * dvt71616 - Fixed a bug when floatparameter is used with bind
       statement in if/generate.
     * [nodvtid] - Array manipluation functions like
       "arr.find_first_index(x) with ...condition..." would incorrectly
       report the error "No field named 'x'" in some cases.
     * dvt70048 - Fixed a bug where the processes were getting scheduled
       in re-NBA region after Postponed region. The errors were getting
       issued in mc2 runs. This was happening when clocking blocks had
       non-zero output delays but the design was getting run with a
       resolution which was higher than the output delay. In this case
       output delays were effectively becoming zero at run time.
     * dvt71985 - (results) Taking a slice of an unpacked net array could
       produce the wrong value under some circumstances.
     * dvt70751 - Fixed a bug when uvm_config_db::get/set functions are
       used with parameterized virtual interfaces with different
       parameters.
     * dvt72057 - (results) For large designs with a common clock driving
       more than 2 million udp instances, udp sensitivity to the clock may
       be lost.
     * dvt71763 - Fixed a bug when interface with real parameters are
       passed into uvm_config_db set/get function or into any other
       parameterized class.
     * dvt30633 - Allowed packed union as bit stream data type.
     * dvt72134 - (results) Registers feeding into a primitive that drives
       an output of a full timing optimized cell could provide incorrect
       results.
     * dvt71528 - (results) Optimized gate-level cells with path delays
       specified in the HDL with large values, could result in zero delay
       propagation delays.
     * dvt72442 - (results) Fix vopt assertion fatal error.
     * dvt62351 - Fixed issues which resulted in vlog/vopt crash when
       structure field-select hierarchical references and nets were used
       as streaming concat element on LHS of assignments. Added support
       for structure filed-select hierarchical references and added error
       checks for nets as streaming concat elements on LHS of assignments.
     * dvt72102 - Error vsim-3043 is now a non-suppressible error. Created
       a new error suppressible 12036 for the Bind to a non-existent
       module.
     * dvt72524 - Fixed a bug where parameter inside super class was not
       found while resolving hierref in bind statement.
     * dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values
       were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values,
       vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.
     * dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port
       driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays
       and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and
       -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.
     * dvt73472 - vsim gave incorrect result when using tagged union over
       an expression with different size elements.
     * dvt73470 - vlog/vopt gave internal error in vgenexpr.c(2897) when a
       wait statement is over a method call of an element of a class
       array.
     * dvt73542 - (results) Gate-level optimized cells with cascading
       sequential udps may under some conditions not evaluate correctly.
     * dvt73581 - Fixed a bug (internal error) when parameter is used as
       queue index.
     * dvt73209 - Starting in the 10.3b release, vopt would sometimes
       generate the error:
       ** Error: test.sv(2246): Questa has encountered an unexpected
       internal error
     * dvt69941 - Vopt would sometimes give incorrect errors like:
       ** Error: test.sv(24): (vopt-2118) The function 'f' is not a valid
       constant function.
       ** Error: test.sv(764): Initializer must be a constant value or
       constant expression.
       when the 'bind' statement was used to instantiate a SystemVerilog
       module into a Verilog target.
     * dvt73431 - Fixed a bug where compiler was crashing in initializing
       a clocking block variable which was an array of struct type.
     * dvt74082 - "const ref" formal argument usage in covergroup sample
       override function was triggering a compiler error. This is now
       allowed.
     * dvt74257 - (results) Using the associative array method 'exists'
       with a wildcard array inside a parameterized class, or through an
       external reference, could result in an incorrect 'false' result.
     * dvt74214 - Fixed a crash in a DPI import call caused by using class
       member fields as the actual arguments of unsized packed open array.
     * dvt72245 - Fixed a vopt internal error when an external decl is
       used in a parameterized class.
     * dvt73554 - In some scenarios we were not giving vsim error when
       using bit select of scalar variable through external declaration.
       For example if we declare logic "abc" in module "top", then
       "top.abc[0]" should result in error. Now a suppressible error is
       issued for these cases.
     * dvt73388 - Fixed a vlog parser bug that prevented the usage of
       overloaded user defined type name as the name of a variable in
       coverpoint expression.
     * dvt71774 - (results) A simulation invoked with an elab or a
       checkpoint file from 3-step flow (with SDF file specified to vopt),
       would not reload SDF on "restart -f".
     * dvt74468 - The implied @* sensitivity should exclude variables
       referenced within a sequential delay.
     * dvt74322 - Fixed a crash when mismatch number of arguments are
       passed in task call.
     * dvt74866 - Fixed a bug when an assign is used on array through
       hier-ref.
     * dvt73310 - Traversing individual words of large SV memories using
       vpi_iterate/vpi_scan functions caused huge memory usage.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt67672 - An array aggregate with an OTHERS choice in an O'SUBTYPE
       or A'ELEMENT context was erroneously being flagged as an Error.
       This has been fixed.
     * dvt71619 - (results) On 64 bits, array shift and rotate operations
       whose second operand ( shift/rotate amount) is INTEGER'LEFT would
       generate a stack overflow error. This has been fixed and the result
       when the shift/rotate amount is INTEGER'LEFT on both 64 and 32 bit
       has been changed to generate the correct value.
     * dvt71805 - In rare cases, simulating with -novopt would give the
       wrong results for a std_logic_vector unless it was logged.
     * dvt72143 - If an uninstantiated package contains signal
       declarations, and an instance of the package is associated with an
       interface package in an entity, package, or subprogram
       instantiation, accesses to the signals could lead to simulator
       error messages of the form:
# ** INTERNAL ERROR: pkgref: export lookup failed for package #8[7]

     * dvt72793 - A PROCESS(ALL) statement in which the ALL represents no
       signals would result in the process having no termination (infinite
       loop).
     * dvt71534 - In Some certain cases, Slice expressions using function
       calls used to give incorrect result. This has been fixed.
     * dvt71423 - Fixed an issue related to recursive instance having
       generate loops further having VHDL or Verilog instances. In these
       cases we either get errors like 'code not found' in vsim or 'failed
       to access library' or 'unable to load design unit' during vopt.
     * dvt73051 - Fixed elaboration crash with subelement association. The
       formal must be an element or subelement of a multidimensional port
       and the actually a 2008 signal expression.
     * dvt72382 - Optimized mode was not reporting multiply driven
       unresolved signals in rare instances of driving package signals.
     * [nodvtid] - Aggregates of signals in subprograms, either as
       parameters to other subprogram, or as targets of signal assignments
       could cause a crash if the aggregate contained both parameters and
       non-parameter signals.
     * dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an
       uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either
       through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer
       designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing
       symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to
       either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of
       the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.
     * dvt74036 - vopt would crash if an object from an instance of a
       generic package was used within a configuration.
     * dvt74124 - Vcom could fail with an internal error when a port map
       statement is present on a block
     * dvt74313 - If an attribute that returned a range is used as the
       expression to a return statement, incorrect machine code could be
       generated. A range is not a valid return value and is now flagged
       as an error a compile time.
     * dvt63309 - In some cases vopt would generate a unexpected message
       about null ranges. Like:
       # ** Warning: [3] test.vhd(3): (vopt-1246) Range 1 to 0 is null.
       The number of these messages have been greatly reduced.
     * [nodvtid] - Logging of composite type variables with embedded
       access type subelements would sometimes not detect and record
       changes to those subelements.
     * dvt66367 - In some specific cases, usage of tick pos attribute was
       giving an error. This has been fixed
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt71348 - (results) vsim gave unresolved reference error when
       there when an assertion referenced a property hierachically. With
       this fix we will now give an error for unresolved paths in a
       property/sequence even if this property/sequence was not
       instantiated in the design.
     * dvt71588 - Fixed a bug where attempt counts for procedural
       assertions were not correctly reported.
     * dvt73226 - Fixed a bug where failure of a cover directive was
       getting considered as an assertion failure in assertdebug mode for
       figuring out if global fail limit for the assertions has reached.
       The global fail limit for the assertions is set using command
       'assertion action -global_fail_limit'.
     * dvt74049 - ATV window showed 'disable iff' for
       'accept_on/reject_on' properties.
     * dvt74471 - SVA sequence 'or' with a boolean RHS gave incorrect
       result.
     * dvt74318 - vsim ran out of memory when a repeat operator was over a
       sequence using local vars.
     * dvt74394 - (results) When SVA accept_on/sync_accept_on expression
       is true it will result in real passes (instead of vacuous passes).
       Pass action blocks are rare but if an assertion using these
       properties has a pass action block then this action block will be
       triggered with this change.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt70846 - Fixed a bug which used to result in internal error in
       mixed designs when VHDL unconstrained array type is used in SV.
     * dvt38882 - When the file permissions on a library of encrypted
       Verilog cells was closed, the VHDL compiler would error out because
       it could not get Verilog to generate an interface file to compile
       against.
     * dvt72760 - (results) In a mixed language design with a verilog
       switch network the extended VCD output for a VHDL signal was not
       calculated properly.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt72970 - Fixed bug that would prevent vsim GUI from being
       displayed when launched from the VRM GUI when vrun was running on a
       grid server.
     * dvt71582 - The keywords passed to the vrun "-select" option are now
       case insensitive. Unrecognized keywords result in an error which
       prevents a regression run from starting (as opposed to a warning
       that the offending keyword is being ignored).
     * [nodvtid] - In VRM, fixed a parameter search-order bug where
       pre-defined parameters or inherited foreach indices could shadow a
       more locally defined parameter of the same name.
     * dvt74238 - In VRM, suppress status summaries when all of the counts
       in a particular summary would be zero.
     * dvt74716 - (results)
The assert scope requires some special case processing to compute "total coverag
e" for an assertion:
    If an assertion has both pass and fail counts
        It is 100% if pass count > 0 and fail count == 0
    else if it has only fail count:
        It is 100% if fail count == 0

The UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST element of the summary record represents this perce
ntage.

The ranktest tool will use and report the 'UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST' metric (whe
n possible). If there is any assertion failure in any test, it is a bug/problem
that must be addressed by the user.

Until ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will use the "%success metric" like the rest of our reporting tools
.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will agree with the "total coverage" nu
mber our reporting tools.
 3. The "%success" metric will be reported in the "Assertions" column.

After ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will ignore the "%success" metric in its calculations.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will NOT agree with the "total coverage
" number our reporting tools.
 3. A "-" will be reported in the "Assertions" column.
 4. A warning message similar to the following will be issued:

** Warning: (vcover-17208) One or more tests contain "assertion failures".
Ranktest will not include "assertion successes" in its ranking metric
calculations (i.e. "assertion successes" will be weighted as 0).

As a consequence, the ranking total coverage metric may be different from the to
tal coverage numbers of other Questa GUI and CLI tools. The reason for this alte
ration is that the "%success" metric is now exhibiting a NON-monotonically incre
asing behavior and can no longer be used in the ranktest "greedy" algorithm. Ran
ktest will NOT use the "assertion pass" metric in any way (neither with nor with
out assertion failures).

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.3e
     * dvt73150 - In some cases, vopt used to crash during PA processing
       when SystemVerilog ++ operator is used. This has been fixed.
     * dvt73202 - In certain cases, Non UPF LRM usage of type
       "top/gen[*].mid/bot" in upf commands (like create_power_domain
       -elements) was resulting in a crash. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt72296 - The vopt used to hang in PA processing in doing analysis
       for static checks when add_power_state was used in UPF. This has
       been fixed by new algorithm to convert power states to
       corresponding PST states. This is enabled by vopt option
       -pa_enable=pwrstatecnv.
     * dvt72971 - In some cases, port punching semantics of UPF supply
       port/net are not happening while generating UPF file from save_upf.
       This has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt68871 - Added support in vlog, vcom and vopt to automatically
       create missing work libraries. Vlog/vcom/vopt command-line option
       '-nocreatelib', or modelsim.ini variable 'CreateLib', may be used
       to stop automatic creation of missing work libraries and revert
       back to the old (10.3x and earlier) behavior.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) There is a change in the meaning of "recursion
       level" specified to various vopt options like
       +acc/+noacc/+cover/+nocover/+initreg/+initmem. Before, this level
       meant how many levels under the current level, the option is to be
       applied. So, level 0 meant no recursion. Now, 0 recursion level
       means full recursion. And this option means how many levels
       including the current level, the option is to be applied.
       The following change in the recursion level keeps the options
       behaving the same way as before.
       previous: +acc=r+/top/r now: +acc=r+/top/r (no change)
       previous: +acc+/top. now: +acc+/top. (no change)
       previous: +acc+top+128 now: +acc+top+0 (full recursion)
       previous: +initreg+0+/top/du+0 now: +initreg+0+/top/du+1 (level ->
       level + 1)
       previous: +cover+lib1.du+2 now: +cover+lib1.du+3 (level -> level +
       1)
     * dvt73792 -
       1. The vsim "checkpoint" command now accepts a file or a directory
       as the pathname.
       Syntax:
       checkpoint [-dir] <pathname>
       The following are the two valid scenarios for specifying a
       directory as the <pathname>. In both these cases a checkpoint file
       named 'vsim.cpt' is created in the specified directory.
          + - The "-dir" option is specified with the <pathname>. If the
            directory doesn't exist then a new one is created.
          + - The "-dir" option is not specified with the <pathname> but
            it represents a pre-exisiting directory.
       It is an error if "-dir" is specified but the <pathname> represents
       a regular file.
       2. vsim's "restore" CLI command and the command line switch
       "-restore" now accept a file or a directory as the pathname. (The
       syntax has not changed, only the semantics).
       Syntax:
       restore <pathname>

     * - If the <pathname> represents a pre-exisiting directory, then a
       checkpoint file named 'vsim.cpt' must exist in the specified
       directory.
     * - Otherwise the <pathname> must represent a checkpoint file.

   3. When the checkpoint is represented by a directory the following new
   function, declared in "mti.h" file, returns that directory name.
   extern char * mti_GetCheckpointDirname PROTO((void));
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt10305 - The [add log], [add wave] and [add list] commands have
       the new -filter and -nofilter switches to allow a one-time
       modification of the WildcardFilter in the command invocation. The
       commands can take as many [-filter <f>] and [-nofilter <f>]
       arguments as the user would like to specify. The valid filters are
       exactly the same set of words that can be applied to the
       WildcardFilter. The filter used during a command starts with the
       WildcardFilter and then applies the user specified filters, if any.
       The -filter values are added to the filter, the -nofilter values
       are removed from the filter. They are applied in the order
       specified so conflicts are resolved with the last specified wins.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A new feature called VHDL Access Path
       Expressions has been introduced which provides improved visibility
       and a more intuitive way of viewing VHDL access variables and
       objects in the Wave Window. Some of the features of vhdl access
       path expressions are:
          + More descriptive pointer values. Values are Dynamic Object
            Identifiers instead of hexadecimal memory address.
          + Access references may be expanded in place in the wave window
            rather than having to inspect individual access objects one by
            one.
          + Ability to add access_var.all to see dereferenced object
            values.
          + Ability to "cast" unconstrained arrays to constrained array
            type.
          + The [accessinfo] command gives metrix and reports about access
            object usage.
          + Enabled with -accessobjdebug switch or AccessObjDebug
            modelsim.ini variable setting.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt68872 - The -mfcu option is now supported when using -libmap.
     * dvt74010 - The existing vsim switch "-nocrossautobins" is enhanced
       to handle a new alternate behavior:
       -nocrossautobins[=[uncond|cond]] Avoid generating auto bins in
       cross coverage computation.", when the value "cond" is specified,
       the auto cross bins are not generated only if there are one or many
       coverable user defined cross bins. when the value "uncond" is
       specified, the auto cross bins generation will be always skipped.
     * dvt74612 - Added a new option 'iddp' to vsim -svext switch. vsim
       -svext=iddp can be used to ignore DPI disable protocol check. For
       example, the following fatal error will be downgraded to a
       suppressible warning. ** Fatal: (vsim-3765) The exported task or
       function 'block20' has been called from within a disabled context.
       This is illegal.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt73161 - Vsim crashed during elaboration when using -nosva
       switch.
     * dvt73467 - Assertion waveform incorrectly showed start attempt at
       every clock edge for 'if..else..' property in some cases when run
       with -assertdebug.
     * dvt73468 - Added support for setting actions for global fail limits
       based on severity of assertions. The command to be used to set the
       limits is 'assertion action' with -severity option.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt74426 - Added a new vsim switch to enable covergroup runtime
       optimizations.

-cvgopt[=[+|-]<mode>[,[+|-]<mode>]*]

Enable Covergroup optimization modes. Valid modes are:

    minhitcnt - stop sampling coverpoint/cross when it is fully covered.

     * dvt73740 - Added a new vsim switch to avoid the coverage collection
       of the coverpoint implicitly defined in a cross. By default the
       coverage of implicit coverpoints are always collected per LRM.

-noimplicitcoverpoint   Avoid collecting coverage for implicit coverpoints.


     * [nodvtid] - New 'vcover parallelmerge' command has been added for
       UCDB and CoverStore database merge with distributed parallel
       processes.
       vcover parallelmerge [< options >]
       Options:
           -rmdb < path >                 : Specify user-defined RMDB file

   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt71739 - The parallel-merge RMDB (for use with VRM) has been
       updated to support coverstores, to accept additional grid
       submission options, and to simplify the messages emitted while
       running.
     * [nodvtid] - VRM now automatically waits for UCDB file to appear
       after Action completion when run on slow file system.
     * dvt73167 - The "-nosummary" option for vrun (VRM) now suppresses
       the summary at the end of a regression run.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.3e
     * dvt73308 - Explicit usage of instance name in create_power_domain
       -elements will be given precedence over extents added because of
       wildcard expansion.
       Example:
       create_power_domain pd1 -elements {top*}
       create_power_domain pd2 -elements {top2}
       Here top1 will be extent of pd1, whereas top2 will be extent of
       pd2.
     * dvt73426 - Command getenv can be used as a tcl command inside a UPF
       file to get the value of any environment variable.
     * [nodvtid] - Added a vopt switch "-pa_staticchecksonly" to do only
       power aware static checking (no simulation) of the design.All other
       PA processing will not be done and hence it will give fast
       turnaround time for static checks.The earlier option '-pa_checks=s'
       still exists to run PA simulation along with static checks.
       This new switch can also be used in conjunction with -pa_checks=s
       to limit the type of static checks.
       e.g
       -pa_staticchecksonly -pa_checks=si would enable only isolation
       static checking.
       -pa_staticchecksonly -pa_checks=sl would enable only level shifter
       static checking.
