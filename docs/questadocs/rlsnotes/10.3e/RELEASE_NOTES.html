[10.3e] Licensing Information
<p>There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.3e.

<p>However if you are migrating to 10.3e from a release like 10.2 and older,
please note the following:

<ul><li>Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The 
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will 
be FLEXnet version 11.11.1.1.
<li>For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
<li>If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
</ul><br>
[10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.<br>
[10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology) library, sources and documentation have been updated to version 2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.<br>
[10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.<br>
[10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.1] Support for GCC versions gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.<br>
<br>
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.3e.</li>

<ul><li>dvt73631 - (results) VHDL 2008 users who use generic packages or subprograms must refresh the associated design units or recompile from source code with this release.  Changes made for correctness affect internal data structures and are incompatible with vhdl-2008 design units generated with earlier releases.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>User Interface  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt71982 - (results) Individual 2-state SV struct field values could be shown incorrectly in the Objects window.  This has been corrected.</li>
 <li>dvt70169 - (results) Logging a System Verilog interface port would result in the actual interface being logged, but not the port.  The fix ensures that the port AND the actual interface are logged so that post-simulation viewing of the WLF file will contain both the port and the actual interface.  NOTE: This required a WLF file version change.  This makes WLF files written with this version of Modelsim/Questa incompatible and unreadable by older version of Modelsim/Questa.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) A new feature called VHDL Access Path Expressions has been introduced which provides improved visibility and a more intuitive way of viewing VHDL access variables and objects in the Wave Window.  Some of the features of vhdl access path expressions are:<ul>
<li>More descriptive pointer values.  Values are Dynamic Object Identifiers instead of hexadecimal memory address.</li>
<li>Access references may be expanded in place in the wave window rather than having to inspect individual access objects one by one.</li>
<li>Ability to add access_var.all to see dereferenced object values.</li>
<li>Ability to "cast" unconstrained arrays to constrained array type.</li>
<li>The [accessinfo] command gives metrix and reports about access object usage.</li>
<li>Enabled with -accessobjdebug switch or AccessObjDebug modelsim.ini variable setting.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt71429 - (results) Using a streaming concat inside a regular vector concat could result in vsim crashing or getting the wrong value.</li>
 <li>dvt71985 - (results) Taking a slice of an unpacked net array could produce the wrong value under some circumstances.</li>
 <li>dvt72057 - (results) For large designs with a common clock driving more than 2 million udp instances, udp sensitivity to the clock may be lost.</li>
 <li>dvt72134 - (results) Registers feeding into a primitive that drives an output of a full timing optimized cell could provide incorrect results.</li>
 <li>dvt71528 - (results) Optimized gate-level cells with path delays specified in the HDL with large values, could result in zero delay propagation delays.</li>
 <li>dvt72442 - (results) Fix vopt assertion fatal error. </li>
 <li>dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values, vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.</li>
 <li>dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.</li>
 <li>dvt73542 - (results) Gate-level optimized cells with cascading sequential udps may under some conditions not evaluate correctly.</li>
 <li>dvt74257 - (results) Using the associative array method 'exists' with a wildcard array inside a parameterized class, or through an external reference, could result in an incorrect 'false' result.</li>
 <li>dvt71774 - (results) A simulation invoked with an elab or a checkpoint file from 3-step flow (with SDF file specified to vopt), would not reload SDF on "restart -f".
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.</li>
 <li>dvt71619 - (results) On 64 bits, array shift and rotate operations whose second operand ( shift/rotate amount) is INTEGER'LEFT
would generate a stack overflow error. This has been fixed and the result when the shift/rotate amount is
 INTEGER'LEFT on both 64 and 32 bit has been changed to generate the correct value.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SVA/PSL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt71348 - (results) vsim gave unresolved reference error when there when an assertion referenced a property hierachically.  With this fix we will now give an error for unresolved paths in a property/sequence even if this property/sequence was not instantiated in the design.</li>
 <li>dvt74394 - (results) When SVA accept_on/sync_accept_on expression is true it will result in real passes (instead of vacuous passes).  Pass action blocks are rare but if an assertion using these properties has a pass action block then this action block will be triggered with this change.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt72760 - (results) In a mixed language design with a verilog switch network the extended VCD output for a VHDL signal was not calculated properly.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) There is a change in the meaning of "recursion level" specified to various vopt options like +acc/+noacc/+cover/+nocover/+initreg/+initmem. Before, this level meant how many levels under the current level, the option is to be applied. So, level 0 meant no recursion. Now, 0 recursion level means full recursion. And this option means how many levels including the current level, the option is to be applied. <br>
The following change in the recursion level keeps the options behaving the same way as before. <br>
previous: +acc=r+/top/r now: +acc=r+/top/r (no change) <br>
previous: +acc+/top. now: +acc+/top. (no change) <br>
previous: +acc+top+128 now: +acc+top+0 (full recursion) <br>
previous: +initreg+0+/top/du+0 now: +initreg+0+/top/du+1 (level -> level + 1) <br>
previous: +cover+lib1.du+2 now: +cover+lib1.du+3 (level -> level + 1)</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt74716 - (results) <pre>
The assert scope requires some special case processing to compute "total coverage" for an assertion:
    If an assertion has both pass and fail counts
        It is 100% if pass count > 0 and fail count == 0
    else if it has only fail count:
        It is 100% if fail count == 0
    	 
The UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST element of the summary record represents this percentage.

The ranktest tool will use and report the 'UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST' metric (when possible). If there is any assertion failure in any test, it is a bug/problem that must be addressed by the user.

Until ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will use the "%success metric" like the rest of our reporting tools.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. The "%success" metric will be reported in the "Assertions" column. 

After ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will ignore the "%success" metric in its calculations.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will NOT agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. A "-" will be reported in the "Assertions" column.
 4. A warning message similar to the following will be issued: 

** Warning: (vcover-17208) One or more tests contain "assertion failures".
Ranktest will not include "assertion successes" in its ranking metric
calculations (i.e. "assertion successes" will be weighted as 0).

As a consequence, the ranking total coverage metric may be different from the total coverage numbers of other Questa GUI and CLI tools. The reason for this alteration is that the "%success" metric is now exhibiting a NON-monotonically increasing behavior and can no longer be used in the ranktest "greedy" algorithm. Ranktest will NOT use the "assertion pass" metric in any way (neither with nor without assertion failures). </li>

<p /><a name="generaldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>General Defects Repaired in 10.3e</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt67937 - -assertfile/-errorfile switches did not work with -load_elab switch.</li>
 <li>dvt70157 - Restored vmake's behavior for VHDL design units to better deal with building incrementally and use of vcom's "-f" switch.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.3e</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt63858 - Toggling the "Within Cells" mode of the Memory List window while a search filter is in use can cause the display of an incomplete list of memories.  This issues has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt71982 - (results) Individual 2-state SV struct field values could be shown incorrectly in the Objects window.  This has been corrected.</li>
 <li>dvt64155 - Two new radixes have been implemented, sfixed and ufixed (signed fixed and unsigned fixed, respectively.)  Values may be displayed using these radixes, for example, [examine -radix ufixed var] might produce the value 1.375.  The criteria for displaying an object as sfixed or ufixed is that the type of the object must be an array of std_ulogic elements between 2 and 64 bits long with a descending range.  (The set of supported types may increase in the future.)  The binary point for the value is implicitly located between the 0th and -1st elements of the array.  The index range for the type need not include 0 or -1, for example (-4 downto -8) in which case the value will be extended for conversion, as appropriate.  If the type does not meet these criteria the value will be displayed  as decimal or unsigned, respectively.  The radix command, global radix dialog and wave window radix menus support these radixes.</li>
 <li>dvt71287 - The "Fixed Point Radix" dialog box was missing the radix "decimal" as a possible base type.  This has been corrected.  Decimal is now the default base selection in the dialog.</li>
 <li>dvt74014 - A malformed [add wave] command can cause the UI to crash.</li>
 <li>dvt74038 - A user defined keyboard short-cut bound to the Simulate->Step->Step commands, or any other global menu operations do not work.  This has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt74187 - The wrong instance scope will sometimes be used when displaying a signals declaration in the Source window from the Wave window.</li>
 <li>dvt74126 - In Questa, the "change" command could crash or incorrectly ignore ".super" psuedo scope.  This has been corrected.</li>
 <li>dvt29745 - Using the Library window popup menu to invoke Simulate (start a simulation) will sometimes produce an error message and fail to launch the simulation.  This occurs after performing a design optimization from the Library window.</li>
 <li>dvt74813 - Mouse Middle Button zoom-out stroke does not work in Wave window when the waveform view starts at 0.</li>
 <li>dvt70169 - (results) Logging a System Verilog interface port would result in the actual interface being logged, but not the port.  The fix ensures that the port AND the actual interface are logged so that post-simulation viewing of the WLF file will contain both the port and the actual interface.  NOTE: This required a WLF file version change.  This makes WLF files written with this version of Modelsim/Questa incompatible and unreadable by older version of Modelsim/Questa.</li>

<ul><li>dvt69512 - A function call in one of the bounds of a part-select produced the following vopt internal error in some cases: "Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error: ../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(114)".</li>
 <li>dvt71073 - Automatic function defined in package would sometimes gives incorrect return value. This has been fixed now.</li>
 <li>dvt70882 - A bit-select of a hierarchical reference connected to a module input port produced incorrect results in some cases if the bit-select index also contained a hierarchical reference.</li>
 <li>dvt71294 - Fixed a bug where a part select expression involving multi-dimensional array having index of multi-dimensional array of type byte (or bit [7:0]) is used.
Example :- int_out_data[15:00] = m_item_h.m_mux_in[sel_line][15:0]; where sel_line is of type bit[7:0]</li>
 <li>dvt71429 - (results) Using a streaming concat inside a regular vector concat could result in vsim crashing or getting the wrong value.</li>
 <li>dvt71701 - A 'defparam' inside a generate clause in a mixed Verilog/VHDL design could cause an erroneous error 10000.</li>
 <li>dvt71616 - Fixed a bug when floatparameter is used with bind statement in if/generate.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Array manipluation functions like "arr.find_first_index(x) with ...condition..." would incorrectly report the error "No field named 'x'" in some cases.</li>
 <li>dvt70048 - Fixed a bug where the processes were getting scheduled in re-NBA region after Postponed region. The errors were getting issued in mc2 runs. This was happening when clocking blocks had non-zero output delays but the design was getting run with a resolution which was higher than the output delay. In this case output delays were effectively becoming zero at run time.</li>
 <li>dvt71985 - (results) Taking a slice of an unpacked net array could produce the wrong value under some circumstances.</li>
 <li>dvt70751 - Fixed a bug when uvm_config_db::get/set functions are used with parameterized virtual interfaces with different parameters.</li>
 <li>dvt72057 - (results) For large designs with a common clock driving more than 2 million udp instances, udp sensitivity to the clock may be lost.</li>
 <li>dvt71763 - Fixed a bug when interface with real parameters are passed into uvm_config_db set/get function or into any other parameterized class.</li>
 <li>dvt30633 - Allowed packed union as bit stream data type.</li>
 <li>dvt72134 - (results) Registers feeding into a primitive that drives an output of a full timing optimized cell could provide incorrect results.</li>
 <li>dvt71528 - (results) Optimized gate-level cells with path delays specified in the HDL with large values, could result in zero delay propagation delays.</li>
 <li>dvt72442 - (results) Fix vopt assertion fatal error. </li>
 <li>dvt62351 - Fixed issues which resulted in vlog/vopt crash when structure field-select hierarchical references and nets were used as streaming concat element on LHS of assignments. Added support for structure filed-select hierarchical references and added error checks for nets as streaming concat elements on LHS of assignments. </li>
 <li>dvt72102 - Error vsim-3043 is now a non-suppressible error. Created a new error suppressible 12036 for the Bind to a non-existent module.
</li>
 <li>dvt72524 - Fixed a bug where parameter inside super class was not found while resolving hierref in bind statement.</li>
 <li>dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values, vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.</li>
 <li>dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.</li>
 <li>dvt73472 - vsim gave incorrect result when using tagged union over an expression with different size elements.</li>
 <li>dvt73470 - vlog/vopt gave internal error in vgenexpr.c(2897) when a wait statement is over a method call of an element of a class array.</li>
 <li>dvt73542 - (results) Gate-level optimized cells with cascading sequential udps may under some conditions not evaluate correctly.</li>
 <li>dvt73581 - Fixed a bug (internal error) when parameter is used as queue index.</li>
 <li>dvt73209 - Starting in the 10.3b release, vopt would sometimes generate the error:<br>
<code>** Error: test.sv(2246): Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error</code></li>
 <li>dvt69941 - Vopt would sometimes give incorrect errors like:<br>
<code>** Error: test.sv(24): (vopt-2118) The function 'f' is not a valid constant function.<br>
** Error: test.sv(764): Initializer must be a constant value or constant expression.</code><br>
when the 'bind' statement was used to instantiate a SystemVerilog module into a Verilog target.</li>
 <li>dvt73431 - Fixed a bug where compiler was crashing in initializing a clocking block variable which was an array of struct type. </li>
 <li>dvt74082 - "const ref" formal argument usage in covergroup sample override function was triggering a compiler error. This is now allowed.</li>
 <li>dvt74257 - (results) Using the associative array method 'exists' with a wildcard array inside a parameterized class, or through an external reference, could result in an incorrect 'false' result.</li>
 <li>dvt74214 - Fixed a crash in a DPI import call caused by using class member fields as the actual arguments of unsized packed open array.</li>
 <li>dvt72245 - Fixed a vopt internal error when an external decl is used in a parameterized class.</li>
 <li>dvt73554 - In some scenarios we were not giving vsim error when using bit select of scalar variable through external declaration. For example if we declare logic "abc" in module "top", then "top.abc[0]" should result in error. Now a suppressible error is issued for these cases. </li>
 <li>dvt73388 - Fixed a vlog parser bug that prevented the usage of overloaded user defined type name as the name of a variable in coverpoint expression.</li>
 <li>dvt71774 - (results) A simulation invoked with an elab or a checkpoint file from 3-step flow (with SDF file specified to vopt), would not reload SDF on "restart -f".
</li>
 <li>dvt74468 - The implied @* sensitivity should exclude variables referenced within a sequential delay.</li>
 <li>dvt74322 - Fixed a crash when mismatch number of arguments are passed in task call.</li>
 <li>dvt74866 - Fixed a bug when an assign is used on array through hier-ref.</li>
 <li>dvt73310 - Traversing individual words of large SV memories using vpi_iterate/vpi_scan functions caused huge memory usage.</li>

 <li>dvt71619 - (results) On 64 bits, array shift and rotate operations whose second operand ( shift/rotate amount) is INTEGER'LEFT
would generate a stack overflow error. This has been fixed and the result when the shift/rotate amount is
 INTEGER'LEFT on both 64 and 32 bit has been changed to generate the correct value.</li>
 <li>dvt71805 - In rare cases, simulating with -novopt would give the wrong results for a std_logic_vector unless it was logged.</li>
 <li>dvt72143 - If an uninstantiated package contains signal declarations, and an instance of the package is associated with an interface package in an entity, package, or subprogram instantiation, accesses to the signals could lead to simulator error messages of the form:
<pre>
# ** INTERNAL ERROR: pkgref: export lookup failed for package #8[7]
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt72793 - A PROCESS(ALL) statement in which the ALL represents no signals would result in the process having no termination (infinite loop).</li>
 <li>dvt71534 - In Some certain cases, Slice expressions using function calls used to give incorrect result. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt71423 - Fixed an issue related to recursive instance having generate loops further having VHDL or Verilog instances. In these cases we either get errors like 'code not found' in vsim or 'failed to access library' or 'unable to load design unit' during vopt.</li>
 <li>dvt73051 - Fixed elaboration crash with subelement association. The formal must be an element or subelement of a multidimensional port and the actually a 2008 signal expression.</li>
 <li>dvt72382 - Optimized mode was not reporting multiply driven unresolved signals in rare instances of driving package signals.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Aggregates of signals in subprograms, either as parameters to other subprogram, or as targets of signal assignments could cause a crash if the aggregate contained both parameters and non-parameter signals.</li>
 <li>dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.</li>
 <li>dvt74036 - vopt would crash if an object from an instance of a generic package was used within a configuration.</li>
 <li>dvt74124 - Vcom could fail with an internal error when a port map statement is present on a block</li>
 <li>dvt74313 - If an attribute that returned a range is used as the expression to a return statement, incorrect machine code could be generated. A range is not a valid return value and is now flagged as an error a compile time.</li>
 <li>dvt63309 - In some cases vopt would generate a unexpected message about null ranges. Like:<br>
# ** Warning: [3] test.vhd(3): (vopt-1246) Range 1 to 0 is null. <br>
The number of these messages have been greatly reduced.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Logging of composite type variables with embedded access type subelements would sometimes not detect and record changes to those subelements.</li>
 <li>dvt66367 - In some specific cases, usage of tick pos attribute was giving an error. This has been fixed</li>

<ul><li>dvt71348 - (results) vsim gave unresolved reference error when there when an assertion referenced a property hierachically.  With this fix we will now give an error for unresolved paths in a property/sequence even if this property/sequence was not instantiated in the design.</li>
 <li>dvt71588 - Fixed a bug where attempt counts for procedural assertions were not correctly reported.</li>
 <li>dvt73226 - Fixed a bug where failure of a cover directive was getting considered as an assertion failure in assertdebug mode for figuring out if global fail limit for the assertions has reached. The global fail limit for the assertions is set using command 'assertion action -global_fail_limit'.</li>
 <li>dvt74049 - ATV window showed 'disable iff' for 'accept_on/reject_on' properties.</li>
 <li>dvt74471 - SVA sequence 'or' with a boolean RHS gave incorrect result.</li>
 <li>dvt74318 - vsim ran out of memory when a repeat operator was over a sequence using local vars.</li>
 <li>dvt74394 - (results) When SVA accept_on/sync_accept_on expression is true it will result in real passes (instead of vacuous passes).  Pass action blocks are rare but if an assertion using these properties has a pass action block then this action block will be triggered with this change.</li>

<ul><li>dvt72970 - Fixed bug that would prevent vsim GUI from being displayed when launched from the VRM GUI when vrun was running on a grid server.</li>
 <li>dvt71582 - The keywords passed to the vrun "-select" option are now case insensitive. Unrecognized keywords result in an error which prevents a regression run from starting (as opposed to a warning that the offending keyword is being ignored).</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - In VRM, fixed a parameter search-order bug where pre-defined parameters or inherited foreach indices could shadow a more locally defined parameter of the same name.</li>
 <li>dvt74238 - In VRM, suppress status summaries when all of the counts in a particular summary would be zero.</li>
 <li>dvt74716 - (results) <pre>
The assert scope requires some special case processing to compute "total coverage" for an assertion:
    If an assertion has both pass and fail counts
        It is 100% if pass count > 0 and fail count == 0
    else if it has only fail count:
        It is 100% if fail count == 0
    	 
The UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST element of the summary record represents this percentage.

The ranktest tool will use and report the 'UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST' metric (when possible). If there is any assertion failure in any test, it is a bug/problem that must be addressed by the user.

Until ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will use the "%success metric" like the rest of our reporting tools.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. The "%success" metric will be reported in the "Assertions" column. 

After ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will ignore the "%success" metric in its calculations.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will NOT agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. A "-" will be reported in the "Assertions" column.
 4. A warning message similar to the following will be issued: 

** Warning: (vcover-17208) One or more tests contain "assertion failures".
Ranktest will not include "assertion successes" in its ranking metric
calculations (i.e. "assertion successes" will be weighted as 0).

As a consequence, the ranking total coverage metric may be different from the total coverage numbers of other Questa GUI and CLI tools. The reason for this alteration is that the "%success" metric is now exhibiting a NON-monotonically increasing behavior and can no longer be used in the ranktest "greedy" algorithm. Ranktest will NOT use the "assertion pass" metric in any way (neither with nor without assertion failures). </li>

<ul><li>dvt73150 - In some cases, vopt used to crash during PA processing when SystemVerilog ++ operator is used. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt73202 - In certain cases, Non UPF LRM usage of type "top/gen[*].mid/bot" in upf commands (like create_power_domain -elements) was resulting in a crash. This has been fixed now.</li>
 <li>dvt72296 - The vopt used to hang in PA processing in doing analysis for static checks when add_power_state was used in UPF. This has been fixed by new algorithm to convert power states to corresponding PST states. This is enabled by vopt option -pa_enable=pwrstatecnv.</li>

<p /><a name="generalenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>General Enhancements in 10.3e</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt68871 - Added support in vlog, vcom and vopt to automatically create missing work libraries. Vlog/vcom/vopt command-line option '-nocreatelib', or modelsim.ini variable 'CreateLib', may be used to stop automatic creation of missing work libraries and revert back to the old (10.3x and earlier) behavior.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) There is a change in the meaning of "recursion level" specified to various vopt options like +acc/+noacc/+cover/+nocover/+initreg/+initmem. Before, this level meant how many levels under the current level, the option is to be applied. So, level 0 meant no recursion. Now, 0 recursion level means full recursion. And this option means how many levels including the current level, the option is to be applied. <br>
The following change in the recursion level keeps the options behaving the same way as before. <br>
previous: +acc=r+/top/r now: +acc=r+/top/r (no change) <br>
previous: +acc+/top. now: +acc+/top. (no change) <br>
previous: +acc+top+128 now: +acc+top+0 (full recursion) <br>
previous: +initreg+0+/top/du+0 now: +initreg+0+/top/du+1 (level -> level + 1) <br>
previous: +cover+lib1.du+2 now: +cover+lib1.du+3 (level -> level + 1)</li>
 <li>dvt73792 - <p>1. The vsim "checkpoint" command now accepts a file or a directory as the pathname.<br /> 
Syntax:<br /> checkpoint [-dir] &lt;pathname&gt;<br /> 
The following are the two valid scenarios for specifying a directory as the &lt;pathname&gt;. In both these cases a checkpoint file named 'vsim.cpt' is created in the specified directory. <br />
<ul>
<li> - The "-dir" option is specified with the &lt;pathname&gt;. If the directory doesn't exist then a new one is created.</li>
<li> - The "-dir" option is not specified with the &lt;pathname&gt; but it represents a pre-exisiting directory.</li></ul></p>
<p>It is an error if "-dir" is specified but the &lt;pathname&gt; represents a regular file.</p>

<p>2. vsim's "restore" CLI command and the command line switch "-restore" now accept a file or a directory as the pathname. (The syntax has not changed, only the semantics).<br /> Syntax:<br /> restore &lt;pathname&gt;<br />
<ul><li> - If the &lt;pathname&gt; represents a pre-exisiting directory, then a checkpoint file named 'vsim.cpt' must exist in the specified directory.</li>
<li> - Otherwise the &lt;pathname&gt; must represent a checkpoint file.</li></ul></p>
<p>3. When the checkpoint is represented by a directory the following new function, declared in "mti.h" file, returns that directory name.<br /> extern char * mti_GetCheckpointDirname PROTO((void));</p></li>

<ul><li>dvt10305 - The [add log], [add wave] and [add list] commands have the new -filter and -nofilter switches to allow
a one-time modification of the WildcardFilter in the command invocation.  The commands can
take as many [-filter &lt;f&gt;] and [-nofilter &lt;f&gt;] arguments as the user would like
to specify.  The valid filters are exactly the same set of words that can be
applied to the WildcardFilter.  The filter used during a command starts with the WildcardFilter and then applies the user specified filters, if any.  The -filter values are added to the filter, the -nofilter values are removed from the
filter. They are applied in the order specified so conflicts are resolved with the last specified wins.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) A new feature called VHDL Access Path Expressions has been introduced which provides improved visibility and a more intuitive way of viewing VHDL access variables and objects in the Wave Window.  Some of the features of vhdl access path expressions are:<ul>
<li>More descriptive pointer values.  Values are Dynamic Object Identifiers instead of hexadecimal memory address.</li>
<li>Access references may be expanded in place in the wave window rather than having to inspect individual access objects one by one.</li>
<li>Ability to add access_var.all to see dereferenced object values.</li>
<li>Ability to "cast" unconstrained arrays to constrained array type.</li>

<ul><li>dvt68872 - The -mfcu option is now supported when using -libmap.</li>
 <li>dvt74010 - The existing vsim switch "-nocrossautobins" is enhanced to handle a new alternate behavior:

-nocrossautobins[=[uncond|cond]] Avoid generating auto bins in cross coverage computation.",

when the value "cond" is specified, the auto cross bins are not generated only if there are one or many coverable user defined cross bins.

when the value "uncond" is specified, the auto cross bins generation will be always skipped.
 </li>
 <li>dvt74612 - Added a new option 'iddp' to vsim -svext switch. vsim -svext=iddp can be used to ignore DPI disable protocol check. For example, the following fatal error will be downgraded to a suppressible warning.

This new switch can also be used in conjunction with -pa_checks=s to limit the type of static checks.<br>
e.g<br>
