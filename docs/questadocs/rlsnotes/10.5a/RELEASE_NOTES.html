<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:
<br>
1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
<br>
OR
<br>
2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines. DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
<br>
The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the above will incur the following warning at elab time
<br>
<pre>
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.
</pre>
and the fatal error at runtime:
<pre>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'
</pre>
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Designs that depend on the IEEE floating point package "float_generic_package" may require a refresh in some situations when simulated using 10.5a. Specifically:
1.      If a design unit that uses functionality from the IEEE floating point package was compiled with an earlier 10.5* release of Questa using the command "vcom -novopt", it may need to be refreshed. If the "-novopt" switch was not used with vcom, then such design units will not need refreshing.
2.      If a PDU generated using an earlier 10.5* release of Questa uses functionality from the IEEE floating point library, it may need to be refreshed.
In these cases vsim would error out with error number 3274 in case a refresh is not done.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="rlsannouncement"></a><font size="4"><b>Release Announcements in 10.5a</b></font>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - <p>
Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - <p>
10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be linked in with "msvcr120.dll".
If you have SystemC or PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be re-compiled with 10.5. 
Windows platform compiler details is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product. 
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for download on a request basis.
<p>
Compiler versions have not been changed compared to previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more details.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) In the next major release (10.6)<br>
   <ul> 
   <li>support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows 8.1
   <li>support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped

<ul><li>dvt84871 - (results) vsim crashed when annotating SDF to a full specify path ( "*>") with path selects on source and destination terminals.

 <li>dvt84969 - (results) Specifying a VHDL instance to $asserton or $assertoff didn't affect the assert statements. It caused error (vsim-8111) to be emitted, indicating no matching object was found.</li>
 <li>dvt83391 - (results) In some situations, a performance optimization for FSDB dumping caused pli errors:

handle to a register, net, variable, port, terminal, or event.
# ** Error: (vsim-PLI-3494) acc_fetch_size(): The object_handle parameter is
not a handle to a net, register, or port, or a bit-select thereof.
setting the env variable MTI_OPT_FSDB=0 will also workaround this problem.</li>
 <li>dvt66421 - (results) When vsim was run with any "-radix" other than "binary", UVM backdoor functions uvm_hdl_deposit and uvm_hdl_force didn't deposit/force the correct value into VHDL data objects.</li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (results) sccom would invoke scparse with the '--c++0x' option by default, which would enable the c++11 standard. The enabling of the c++11 standard by default would lead to scparse compilation errors in certain cases, while the g++ compilation would run fine. sccom has been fixed not to pass '--c++0x' by default. If a design has c++11 constructs, sccom needs to be invoked with the '-std=c++11' option so that both, g++ and scparse will run with the c++11 standard enabled during compilation.</li>

<ul><li>dvt78423 - When the design unit being instantiated was contained inside library 'work', and the design unit of the scope
of the instantiation statement was contained in a library that was not named 'work', vopt (and vsim in -novopt flow)
would fail to find the instantiated design unit in spite of using -L work. Using -L ./work would make the test
pass. This has been fixed, and now -L ./work is no longer required.</li>
 <li>dvt85061 - Added a sub-option 'compress' to option -createlib to automatically create compressed missing libraries.
i.e. whenever a new library is created based on -createlib option, it is created compressed. The syntax
is -createlib=compress.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Usability improvements and bug fixes have been made to Questa's library search features. There are no known incompatibilities with earlier library search operations. All working designs will continue to elaborate as they have in the past. 
<br>
The following new features have been added to Questa's library search algorithm:<br>
1. A new option called -Ldir has been added to vopt and vsim.<br>
This option allows users to pass container folders for the libraries specified with -L/-Lf options. Once a container folder has been specified, the libraries contained in this folder can be directly referenced using their logical names. When multiple -Ldir options are used, the tool searches in the order in which -Ldir paths are specified on the command line. $cwd is always searched before any -Ldir options, as if there was an implicit "-Ldir ." specified first on the command line.
<br>
2. Vopt now detects inconsistencies between its -L/-Lf options and the options passed to vlog. Any inconsistency that can possibly result in a difference in the composition of the design will generate a warning.<br>

3. A new option -libverbose=libmap has been added to display library map pattern matching information during compilation.
<br>
4. Some design units were missing source information next to their loading messages with -libverbose=prlib. This has been fixed. All design units now consistently show their source libraries when -libverbose=prlib is used.<br>

5. A new option -work has been added to vsim. This is an optional option; When used, it would override the library in which vsim writes the optimized design generated by the internally invoked vopt command in the 2-step flow.
<br>
6. Error messages vsim-19 and vopt-19, generated for non-existent -L/-Lf libraries, are now suppressible.</li>
