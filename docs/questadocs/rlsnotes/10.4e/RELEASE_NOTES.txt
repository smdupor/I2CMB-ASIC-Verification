   Key Information
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) Periodic encryption key improvements.
       The default RSA key for encryption is the new 2048-bit key
       MGC-VERIF-SIM-RSA-2 key and overall encryption security has been
       improved. In line with our encryption key rollover policy, the
       existing default key will be retired in the next release.

   Release Announcements in 10.4e
     * [nodvtid] -
       [10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been
       discontinued.
       [10.4] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.
       However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4e

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) Periodic encryption key improvements.
       The default RSA key for encryption is the new 2048-bit key
       MGC-VERIF-SIM-RSA-2 key and overall encryption security has been
       improved. In line with our encryption key rollover policy, the
       existing default key will be retired in the next release.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt73179 - (results) Fix an improper vopt optimization when DPI
       import call is involved in an always block.
     * dvt84015 - (results) The non-standard feature of System Verilog
       "force" and "release" statements that target a select of a variable
       (as opposed to a net) do not fully support a non-constant rhs. A
       warning is issued to this effect, and the resulting behavior may
       not match the expected behavior for force and release semantics
       involving a non-constant rhs. The behavior has been changed in this
       release such that the rhs is evaluated just once at the time the
       force is executed and is applied as though it is constant and does
       not update forced value subsequently when any of the rhs variables
       change value. Previously, the forced value would be updated when
       the rhs variables change value, but any subsequent force or release
       on the same target would not cancel the force. This old behavior
       can be selected by specifying the vsim -reevalvarbitforces option.
     * dvt84871 - (results) vsim crashed when annotating SDF to a full
       specify path ( "*>") with path selects on source and destination
       terminals. This happened only when the specify block contained more
       than 64 paths and the width of the source and destination
       part-selects were different. E.g. (a[17:9] *> y[36:18]) = (0);
     * dvt84969 - (results) Specifying a VHDL instance to $asserton or
       $assertoff didn't affect the assert statements. It caused error
       (vsim-8111) to be emitted, indicating no matching object was found.
     * dvt83391 - (results) In some situations, a performance optimization
       for FSDB dumping caused pli errors: # ** Error: (vsim-PLI-3532)
       acc_vcl_add(): The object_handle parameter is not a handle to a
       register, net, variable, port, terminal, or event. # ** Error:
       (vsim-PLI-3494) acc_fetch_size(): The object_handle parameter is
       not a handle to a net, register, or port, or a bit-select thereof.
       setting the env variable MTI_OPT_FSDB=0 will also workaround this
       problem.
     * dvt66421 - (results) When vsim was run with any "-radix" other than
       "binary", UVM backdoor functions uvm_hdl_deposit and uvm_hdl_force
       didn't deposit/force the correct value into VHDL data objects.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) While reading from a file into a memory using
       fread, when EOF was encountered, the remaining bytes of the memory
       were filled with newline characters. Now, after fixing this issue,
       zeros are filled in remaining bytes.
     * dvt83519 - (results) Report vsim arguments with which elaboration
       or checkpoint was created.
     * dvt69035 - (results) Support of -seq_udp_delay added. Specify a
       constant delay for all sequential UDP's in the design and set all
       other structural delays to zero

   SystemC Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) sccom would invoke scparse with the '--c++0x'
       option by default, which would enable the c++11 standard. The
       enabling of the c++11 standard by default would lead to scparse
       compilation errors in certain cases, while the g++ compilation
       would run fine. sccom has been fixed not to pass '--c++0x' by
       default. If a design has c++11 constructs, sccom needs to be
       invoked with the '-std=c++11' option so that both, g++ and scparse
       will run with the c++11 standard enabled during compilation.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt83252 - (results) A problem has been fixed that prevented
       parameters specified in a parent testplan from being correctly
       passed down to a child testplan.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt80521 - (results) Isolation/Level-shifter strategies with
       location parent are now ignored for open output ports.
     * dvt82076 - (results) There is change in behavior in
       CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY/CORRUPT_STATE_ON_ACTIVITY simstates for flops.
       Now, the flop outputs would not corrupt if there is a change in
       input('D') in COA/CSOA simstate. Use the vopt option
       -pa_enable=coainputcrpt to achieve flop corruption with change in
       'D'.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There is a change in behavior of vopt option
       "-pa_upfsyntaxchecks". Earlier using this option with vopt would
       only do syntax checking of the UPF and exit.Now using this option
       with design top would do syntax checking of the UPF file and if
       successful will invoke actual PA UPF elaboration. If user doesn't
       specify any design top with this option then tool will only do
       syntax checking of UPF and exit(same as old behavior).
     * dvt83155 - (results) Added support for liberty based corruption for
       all liberty cells under pa option 'libertycellcrpt'
       (-pa_enable=libertycellcrpt)
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt84629 - [ModelSim Microsemi] Wrong license feature name
       'actelmsimvlog' mentioned in licensing error message for expired
       licenses. Should have been 'microsemimsim'.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt83573 - The Wave window view will jump to the end time when
       selecting items in the Structure window. This issue as been fixed.
       To work around the problem in existing releases, set
       PrefWave(ScrollOnRunComplete) 0, however, with this option
       disabled, the Wave window will not scroll to the end after a run
       either.
     * dvt74842 - When saving a window image on Windows, the error
       "expected integer but got "-x"" is reported. This problem has been
       fixed.
     * dvt86473 - Objects window will mis-sort items when the Active time
       is inactive.

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt73179 - (results) Fix an improper vopt optimization when DPI
       import call is involved in an always block.
     * dvt84015 - (results) The non-standard feature of System Verilog
       "force" and "release" statements that target a select of a variable
       (as opposed to a net) do not fully support a non-constant rhs. A
       warning is issued to this effect, and the resulting behavior may
       not match the expected behavior for force and release semantics
       involving a non-constant rhs. The behavior has been changed in this
       release such that the rhs is evaluated just once at the time the
       force is executed and is applied as though it is constant and does
       not update forced value subsequently when any of the rhs variables
       change value. Previously, the forced value would be updated when
       the rhs variables change value, but any subsequent force or release
       on the same target would not cancel the force. This old behavior
       can be selected by specifying the vsim -reevalvarbitforces option.
     * dvt84358 - Fixed a vopt crash in an optimization of an always
       block.
     * dvt84871 - (results) vsim crashed when annotating SDF to a full
       specify path ( "*>") with path selects on source and destination
       terminals. This happened only when the specify block contained more
       than 64 paths and the width of the source and destination
       part-selects were different. E.g. (a[17:9] *> y[36:18]) = (0);
     * [nodvtid] - Extended Mac OS new-line warning message to cover line
       comments when the line comments is the first text found within a
       source file.
     * dvt84969 - (results) Specifying a VHDL instance to $asserton or
       $assertoff didn't affect the assert statements. It caused error
       (vsim-8111) to be emitted, indicating no matching object was found.
     * dvt84189 - Inline randomization constraints with type casts would
       sometimes generate compilation errors like:
** Error: test.sv(10): Illegal field 'my_type'
     * dvt83391 - (results) In some situations, a performance optimization
       for FSDB dumping caused pli errors: # ** Error: (vsim-PLI-3532)
       acc_vcl_add(): The object_handle parameter is not a handle to a
       register, net, variable, port, terminal, or event. # ** Error:
       (vsim-PLI-3494) acc_fetch_size(): The object_handle parameter is
       not a handle to a net, register, or port, or a bit-select thereof.
       setting the env variable MTI_OPT_FSDB=0 will also workaround this
       problem.
     * dvt85773 - vsim crashed with "+bitblast" when a module contained a
       wide port in $setuphold (or $recrem) but not corresponding delayed
       nets. For example, "$setuphold(posedge CLK, posedge A,
       0,0,notify);" where A is a wide port. In comparison,
       "$setuphold(posedge CLK, posedge A, 0,0,notify,,, dCLK, dA);",
       which has the delayed nets specified, did not crash.
     * dvt85744 - Fixed a vopt crash when randomize with "with" is called
       on a class present in different package.
     * dvt85552 - Fixed a vopt crash when a structure parameter is passed
       to module and is also used to pass its one field to another module
       instance in a generate loop.
     * dvt85511 - Fixed a vopt crash when interface instance array element
       is passed as port in a generate loop.
     * dvt85354 - Fixed a vopt crash when interface array is passed as
       port in a module and size of the interface array is based on the
       parameter value passed to same module.
     * dvt85355 - Fixed a vopt invalid error when interface array element
       is passed as port and vopt is not able to evaluate the value of
       index.
     * dvt85027 - Fixed an invalid vsim error 3371 when a parameter is
       initialized with constant function and this parameter value is used
       as index while declaring a typedef.
     * dvt80327 - Fixed a vlog crash when default parameters are used for
       non parameterized class.
     * dvt84147 - Allowed the comma in the path given to -pli argument.
     * dvt84543 - Fixed a vlog error when a class is passed as argument to
       new operator.
     * dvt84512 - Corrected the output of $countbits when used on array
       size larger than 32 bits.
     * dvt84079 - An interface was showing all z's on port connection in a
       corner scenario when interface is instantiated inside generate and
       also used as virtual interface. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt80740 - Added an error check when constant variable defined
       inside interface is changed.
     * dvt83576 - Fixed a vopt crash when following type of expression is
       used. Expression:- array[index].element |= constant, where index is
       some external reference to a part-select expression.
     * dvt81993 - Added a warning when array dimension greater than the
       size of an int is declared.
     * dvt85884 - Fixed a bug which resulted in vsim crash when dynamic
       rand array is declared as field inside a structure.
     * dvt84049 - Fixed a bug which resulted in vopt assert failure when
       using interface instance before its instantiation in the same
       scope.
     * dvt85029 - Fixed a bug which resulted in weak output of a buf
       (weak1, weak0) primitive to be incorrectly converted to a strong
       output.
     * dvt78378 - Fixed a bug which resulted in wrong vsim time error
       while overriding parameters of unpacked structure type.
     * dvt33609 - Fixed a vopt-7063 suppressible error when bind instance
       is used in left hand side of defparam statement.
     * dvt66421 - (results) When vsim was run with any "-radix" other than
       "binary", UVM backdoor functions uvm_hdl_deposit and uvm_hdl_force
       didn't deposit/force the correct value into VHDL data objects.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) While reading from a file into a memory using
       fread, when EOF was encountered, the remaining bytes of the memory
       were filled with newline characters. Now, after fixing this issue,
       zeros are filled in remaining bytes.
     * dvt86366 - Fixed an invalid vlog-13216 error when class handles are
       assigned in foreach loop.
     * dvt86359 - Removed addition of force and release target in implicit
       sensitivity list.
     * dvt86238 - Vopt was hanging when bit select and part-select are
       used on nets in complex scenario. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt84391 - Fixed a vopt crash after suppressing error 8303. The
       crash was seen when non-constant multiplier was used in replicate
       expression in automatic function.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt82810 - A function containing a nested function called to
       initialize a subtype of an object declared in the outer function
       could cause the design to crash when loaded.
     * dvt83738 - Incorrect code was generated for constant-index signal
       assignments when the array elements are generic types. As a result,
       the simulator could crash.
     * dvt81426 - If an array-valued signal has only constant-index signal
       assignments in a particular process, and the process contains an
       expression involving either the 'driving or 'driving_value
       attribute, incorrect code was generated for the attribute
       expression. As a result, the simulator could crash during
       evaluation of the expression.
     * dvt85740 - The compiler (vcom) would issue an Internal error
       message when an array aggregate expression was associated with a
       port of a direct instantiation (ENTITY) when that port was of an
       array-of-unconstrained array type and the port subtype was fully
       constrained at the inner array and the constraint depended on
       generics of the ENTITY, different from the ENTITY of the design
       unit that contains the direct instantiation statement.
     * dvt86029 - The simulator would crash when a port map associated an
       array subelement of a record type signal with an array type port,
       when the array subelement was defined as an unconstrained array
       (i.e, the record type was record-with-unconstrained array

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * [nodvtid] - (results) sccom would invoke scparse with the '--c++0x'
       option by default, which would enable the c++11 standard. The
       enabling of the c++11 standard by default would lead to scparse
       compilation errors in certain cases, while the g++ compilation
       would run fine. sccom has been fixed not to pass '--c++0x' by
       default. If a design has c++11 constructs, sccom needs to be
       invoked with the '-std=c++11' option so that both, g++ and scparse
       will run with the c++11 standard enabled during compilation.

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt84105 - vopt exits with code 211 when a VHDL attribute is used
       in a PSL expression.
     * dvt84891 - Assertion having $past with clock gating fires
       incorrectly.
     * dvt85213 - Assertion with suffix implication having boolean LHS and
       RHS fired incorrectly after that assertion was disabled by
       $assertoff.
     * dvt85418 - Assertion fires incorrectly when using SVA 'not'
       operator over a sequence.
     * dvt85985 - vsim crashes during 'coverage save' with -assertcover.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt84862 - Fixed a bug which resulted in internal vopt error when
       nested Verilog module instantiates VHDL entity with generics
       override.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.4e
     * dvt83252 - (results) A problem has been fixed that prevented
       parameters specified in a parent testplan from being correctly
       passed down to a child testplan.
     * [nodvtid] - Vrun -suspend now releases Questa licences upon
       suspension.
     * dvt66418 - VRM local rerun functionality now re-evaluates the
       parameters of the action that is going to be rerun.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.4e
     * dvt21036 - The Search bar options such as Exact Match and Case
       Sensitive, have been made persistent between sessions.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.4e
     * dvt83570 - Added new vsim switch "-solvefailseverity" for
       specifying error message severity when randomize() failure is
       detected. -solvefailseverity= Valid values: 0 - no error (default)
       1 - warning 2 - error 3 - failure 4 - fatal
     * [nodvtid] - Added a vlog and vopt -svext=tzas option that runs a
       top-blocking always @* at time zero, same as is done for an
       always_comb, meaning that the always block will behave as though
       triggered at time zero even if none of the variables and nets in
       the implied sensitivity change value at time zero.
     * dvt85541 - Improved performance of switch network simulation where
       HDL forces are present.
     * dvt83519 - (results) Report vsim arguments with which elaboration
       or checkpoint was created.
     * dvt84276 - Support the initialization of dynamic array with
       '{default:expression}.
     * dvt80842 - Allowed the shuffle method on associative arrays with
       -svext=omaa
     * dvt69035 - (results) Support of -seq_udp_delay added. Specify a
       constant delay for all sequential UDP's in the design and set all
       other structural delays to zero
     * [nodvtid] - vlog's -E output would not emit `line directives with
       anything other than '0' for the "level" parameter. Valid values for
       the "level" parameter are 0, 1 or 2.
     * [nodvtid] - Added a new SVPrettyPrintflags option 'R' in
       modelsim.ini file to specify the radix for printing the data
       specified with %p format. e.g. SVPrettyPrintFlags=R shows the
       output of specifier %p as per the specifed radix(d|b|o|h). It
       changes the output in $display and similar systasks. It does not
       affect formatted output functions ($displayh etc).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Enhancements in 10.4e
     * dvt81904 - sccom has a new option '-uvmc' and a modelsim.ini option
       'UseUvmc' that would enable automatic linking of the precompiled
       UVMC libraries shipped with the product. This option is a link time
       only option and should be specified with 'sccom -link'.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Enhancements in 10.4e
     * dvt81633 - Added support for case..endcase type of property in SVA.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.4e
     * [nodvtid] - vcover parallelmerge has been enhanced to optimize
       number of parallel merge jobs such that each merge job will have at
       least 2 files to merge. For example, if user asks 8 files to merge
       with 8 parallel jobs, parallelmerge would run 8 parallel merge jobs
       with 1 file each. With this enhancement, parallelmerge will
       automatically reduce the number of parallel merge jobs to 4.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4e
     * dvt84224 - Added "Class Type" column in Tracker window for showing
       parameterized class specialization attributes of linked coverage
       scopes
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.4e
     * dvt80521 - (results) Isolation/Level-shifter strategies with
       location parent are now ignored for open output ports.
     * dvt82076 - (results) There is change in behavior in
       CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY/CORRUPT_STATE_ON_ACTIVITY simstates for flops.
       Now, the flop outputs would not corrupt if there is a change in
       input('D') in COA/CSOA simstate. Use the vopt option
       -pa_enable=coainputcrpt to achieve flop corruption with change in
       'D'.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There is a change in behavior of vopt option
       "-pa_upfsyntaxchecks". Earlier using this option with vopt would
       only do syntax checking of the UPF and exit.Now using this option
       with design top would do syntax checking of the UPF file and if
       successful will invoke actual PA UPF elaboration. If user doesn't
       specify any design top with this option then tool will only do
       syntax checking of UPF and exit(same as old behavior).
     * dvt83155 - (results) Added support for liberty based corruption for
       all liberty cells under pa option 'libertycellcrpt'
       (-pa_enable=libertycellcrpt)
     * dvt84673 - Added support to report the "clamp_value" set on a
       signal by "set_port_attributes" UPF command. It will be reported
       under the section of isolation strategy in Questa PASim report
       files report.upf.txt and report.pa.txt.
