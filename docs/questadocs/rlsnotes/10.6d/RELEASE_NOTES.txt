   Release Announcements in 10.6d
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5
            x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release,
            gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for
            SystemC have been discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
            limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
          + We regularly review our OS/Platform support for
            Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products
            to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
            That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
            action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in
            an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
            We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from
            now. We began notifications of this change back in January
            2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
            As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are
            discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows
            10. So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.
            That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7
            & 8.1 in the future.
            Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to
            discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows
            version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10. However we will
            continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7
            release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019,
            10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for
            Windows 7.
          + Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
            plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
            documentation are fully functional.
            Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
            result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
            current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF
            manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web
            browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this
            behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is
            compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
            page-oriented layout.
            Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between
            topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference
            material, and other related technical content.

          + (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
            deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
            deprecation process:
               o The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a
                 deprecation suppressible error message.
               o In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will
                 not be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with
                 error message.
               o Customer scripts using this switch will have to be
                 changed. This legacy switch forces incremental mode
                 (pre-6.0 behavior) which is sub-optimal, and it is no
                 longer maintained.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6d
       SystemVerilog Compatibility

     * dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one
       element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are
       different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added a new suppressible error 7080 for the
       non singular condition expressions in 'if' and 'else if'
       statements. For eg. reg ar[5]; if (ar) // non singular condition
       ... This will give suppressible error now.
     * dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp.
       For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from
       SV files is required due to this change.
     * dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would
       often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize
       results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have
       been resolved.
     * dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver
       profile report by removing details that are not relevant to
       performance, along with the following improvements: - display CPU
       time in seconds (instead of ticks) - display CPU time stats for top
       10 individual calls for each callsite
     * dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed
       structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of
       a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
       The support has been added as default and will be an error with
       -pedanticerrors.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function
       call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual
       argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument.
       This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the
       formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code
       to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument
       values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.
     * dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could
       produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing
       composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.
     * dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being
       used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output.
       This has been fixed.

   SystemC Compatibility
     * dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow
       checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as
       the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active
       constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design
       has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported
       constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage
       that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.
       SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be
       recompiled with the 10.6a release.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being
       printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of
       real types in VCD.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt90645 - (results) Wildcard bins are now supported in covergroup
       crosses.
     * dvt102132 - (results) User defined function calls are now supported
       in coverpoint bin "with" expressions
     * dvt105070 - (results) Assuming that LRM has a typo on missing open
       square bracket in bin syntax, allowing coverpoint name in binrhs
       without any with-expression

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add"
       command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design
       elements which are inferred as registers e.g.
       regs/logic/bits/functions etc.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
       ___________________________________________________________________

       General Defects Repaired in 10.6d

     * dvt85852 - Added support for -autoprofile usage with -elab,
       -elab_cont, and -load_elab.
     * dvt98187 - Added support for -autoprofile on a cold restore
     * dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being
       printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of
       real types in VCD.
     * dvt104690 - An issue related to licensing is fixed. The issue
       caused a hang if the checked-out license feature is about to expire
       (default is 15 days before expiration). A workaround was to set the
       'MGLS_EXP_WARN_DAYS' variable to '1'. Now, the workaround is not
       needed. This issue was not applicable to Windows platform.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * dvt102099 - The noforce command incorrectly returns an error status
       when used in vsim -batch mode. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt104114 - An incorrect warning "VSIM-3581" is no longer issues
       when using -appendlog along with -restore or -load_elab options.
     * dvt36562 - Using the mouse scroll wheel in the Memory View window
       now scrolls the window contents correctly.
     * dvt105987 - The "change" command failed to accept variable names
       with index or select expressions, only in -batch mode. This issues
       has bee resolved.
     * dvt103413 - The GUI crash reading a wlf file containing SV union
       nets has been resolved.
     * dvt107745 - GUI error occurs when trying to display FSM coverage
       analysis on a Task based FSM. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt107688 - In some cases, signals sent from the source window to
       other windows will not be from the correct scope. This issue has
       been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added a new suppressible error 7080 for the
       non singular condition expressions in 'if' and 'else if'
       statements. For eg. reg ar[5]; if (ar) // non singular condition
       ... This will give suppressible error now.
     * dvt102251 - In some rare cases, randomize() would produce a
       solution that would violate an equality/inequality constraint
       between two random variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp.
       For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from
       SV files is required due to this change.
     * [nodvtid] - Questa now supports "integral_number"s as a part of an
       "enum_identifier" within an "enum_name_declaration" production.
     * [nodvtid] - In fatal errors involving virtual interfaces Questa may
       have emitted an incorrect file number in the message.
     * dvt102853 - Fixed a simulator internal error when a DPI open array
       with an unsized packed dimension is used. The message is similar
       to: Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error:
       ../../src/vsim/svdpi_runtime.c(2216).
     * dvt17863 - Added support for the use of the 'array.size()' builtin
       function within the context of index expressions for random
       unpacked dynamic arrays/queues in constraints.
     * dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one
       element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are
       different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.
     * dvt101989 - In some rare cases, randomize() would generate an
       invalid solution when evaluating constraint expressions of the
       following form: "arr.sum() with (int'(item == const_val))". This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt102459 - Iterative (foreach) constraints may now specify an
       array parameter instead of an array variable on which to iterate.
     * dvt102717 - In some rare cases, randomize() would ignore the 'with'
       clause associated with constraint expressions involving a builtin
       array reduction function (e.g. "foo.bar.sum() with
       (int'(item.baz))". This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt103611 - In some cases, randomize() scenarios involving large
       numbers of 'soft' constraints would solve slowly and/or fail due to
       memory allocation errors. Significant improvements to the
       constraint solver related to the evaluation of 'soft' constraints
       have been made, resolving these issues.
     * dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would
       often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize
       results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have
       been resolved.
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases where a fork..join block contained a
       nested fork..join_any sub-block, disabling the outer block would
       not immediately disable the inner block.
     * dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * dvt101580 - Certain styles of continuous selected signal assignment
       statements with zero delay would not execute properly when
       optimized, either in an optimized design or a design compiled with
       the PE version of the product.
     * dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function
       call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual
       argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument.
       This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the
       formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code
       to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument
       values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.
     * dvt103675 - In some cases where are large number of objects are
       declared the order of declaration could negatively impact vcom
       performance.
     * dvt102732 - In some specific cases of mixed design where
       'last_value was used.Simulation use to give incorrect result under
       -mlopt option. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could
       produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing
       composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.
     * dvt103546 - The implicit matching operators for STD_ULOGIC, when
       the operands were locally static, would not be evaluated correctly
       by the compiler when performing an optimization to replace the
       expression with a known value
     * dvt103968 - Subprogram instantiation called with out-of-range
       actual would sometimes not be caught as an error.
     * dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being
       used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output.
       This has been fixed.
     * dvt67231 - Special characters in a comment that was inside an
       encrypted region could cause a parsing error.
     * dvt106202 - An internal error was report in some cases in vcom or
       vopt if an array signal is indexed or sliced. The index expression
       or slice expression contains a locally static expression that has a
       primary is a record or array. For example:
constant C : integer_vector(0 to 1) := ( 3, 6);
signal   S : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
....
   o <= S(C(0)); -- The use of C(0) can cause an internal error

     * dvt106288 - If a package contains a generic of the same name as a
       generic of an entity, and the package is instantiated within the
       entity, the compiler may incorrectly use the static value of the
       entity's generic rather than the package's generic when producing
       code for the package instantiation.
     * dvt104870 - A simulator crash could occur if an object was declared
       with an initial expression that was the name of another object
       whose initial value was a function call whose return type mark was
       the predefined attribute SUBTYPE with a prefix that was one of the
       function input parameters (when that parameter is of an
       unconstrained composite type).

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow
       checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as
       the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active
       constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design
       has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported
       constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage
       that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.
       SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be
       recompiled with the 10.6a release.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * dvt103855 - Assertion clocked with a clocking block variable fired
       incorrectly.
     * dvt104131 - Assertions using bit streaming operator did not
       evaluate correctly.
     * dvt102556 - vsim gave incorrect coverage result for (a ##1 b |-> c)
       type of properties.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * dvt104125 - Fixed minor error in VRM in procedure which parses the
       Job ID from an RTDA log file.
     * dvt105414 - Fixed an infinite-loop bug in the VRM HTML report
       generator's RMDB expansion algorithm which would occur when a
       usertcl procedure implementing a "foreach" parameter tried to
       expand another parameter.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.6d
     * dvt104923 - Incorrect time advance values in the WLF file caused
       signal transitions to be incorrect in some rare conditions. This
       bug generally manifested itself by signals transitions in the wave
       window showing correctly when zoomed in, but disappearing as one
       zoomed out, then possibly showing again upon zooming out even
       further. This has been fixed, but the bug is in the WLF writer and
       requires WLF files demonstrating this behavior to be regenerated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.6d
     * dvt79741 - When the performance profiler collects a sample in code
       not associated with an instance of the design it is reported in the
       structural report at "NoContext". Some samples previously reported
       as "NoContext" are now reported as "AssertionActivity" and
       "CoverageActivity". Samples reported as "AssertionActivity"
       indicate simulator time executing processes specific to assertions.
       The simulator combines multiple assertions into a single process
       when possible and it's not possible to attribute the sample to the
       actual process. Samples reported as "CoverageActivity" indicate
       simulator time executing processes specific to coverage, but the
       specific coverage statement is not known.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.6d
     * dvt106543 - Color preference settings have been added for the
       message indicators at the top of the Wave window. The new
       preference variables are PrefWave(messageNoteColor),
       PrefWave(messageWarnColor), and PrefWave(messageFailColor).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6d
     * dvt101596 -

-add_seq_delay < value > { < units >}


Specify a constant delay value for all sequential UDPs in the design.

If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is zero, new delay value will be used
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is higher, new delay value will be ign
ored.
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is lower, new delay value will be repl
aced.
No other structural delay will be changed with this option.
Unit is optional, if not specified default unit will be used.


     * dvt78963 - Command affected: -msglimit. Now -msglimit error
       -msglimitcount < count >, will stop the Questa after "count" number
       of errors. -msglimit warning -msglimitcount < count >, will stop
       the Questa after "count" number of warnings.
     * [nodvtid] - Allow empty procedural case statements. I.e.: case
       statements with no branches defined. By default the vlog compiler
       will continue to emit an error when no branches are defined. This
       error is suppressible.
     * [nodvtid] - Vlog's command line option -svfilesuffix now accepts
       more characters as valid.
     * dvt73654 - Added support for random variables in index expressions
       for both packed and unpacked arrays in constraints. The vsim option
       "-svrandext=randindex" can be used to enable/disable this
       extension. This extension is enabled by default. This extension
       replaces the existing extension for random variable support in
       index expressions for packed arrays ("-svrandext=packrandidx" is
       deprecated).
     * dvt88366 - added two new options into "vcd add" command: -
       "-nocell" - "-l level" -nocell will suppress logging into cell -l
       level will be similar to the level in $dumpvar Usage: vcd add
       [-file ] [-dumpports] [-in] [-inout] [-internal] [-out] [-ports]
       [[-r] | [-r -optcells] | [-l level]] [-nocell] ...
     * [nodvtid] - Added vlog command line option to ignore System Verilog
       keyword and treat them as identifiers under option
       -ignoresvkeywords="keyword1[,keyword2]".
     * dvt103176 -
       Constraint solver vsim switch -solvefailseverity has been enhanced.
       The error message for randomize() failure and randomize(null)
       failure can be controlled separately with different severities. The
       existing usage of -solvefailseverity is not impacted.
       -solvefailseverity=<value1>[<value2>]
   Specify error message severity when randomize() and randomize(null) failures
are detected.
   When both <value1> and <value2> are present, <value1> specifies the severity
of randomize(),
   and <value2> specifies the severity for randomize(null). When only <value1> i
s present, the
   severity setting applies to both randomize() and randomize(null).
   Valid values for both <value1> and  <value2>:
      0 - no error
      1 - warning
      2 - error
      3 - failure
      4 - fatal

       The companion modelsim.ini variable has been enhanced for the
       similar change.
     * dvt5888 - Questa now supports reading vector based port
       declarations in evcd file. The option to read this file is -vcdstim
       which is an existing option. There is no additional option needed
       to use this functionality. Vector based evcd file can be generated
       from Questa using +dumpports+collapse option.
     * dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver
       profile report by removing details that are not relevant to
       performance, along with the following improvements: - display CPU
       time in seconds (instead of ticks) - display CPU time stats for top
       10 individual calls for each callsite
     * dvt100019 - Added SystemVerilog extension to improve support for
       function calls in constraints with complex interactions between the
       function input(s) and function output by allowing functions to be
       called multiple times. Specify vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=funcback" to enable this extension.
     * dvt99791 - For C/C++ auto compile, modelsim.ini variable
       "DpiCppInstall" has been added which is the equivalent of the
       '-dpicppinstall' command line option.
     * dvt99791 -
The '-cppinstall' and '-cpppath' options will be honored for C/C++ auto compile
in the absence of '-dpicppinstall' and '-dpicpppath' options.
For SystemC compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path is
 the following:
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath
For C/C++ auto compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path
 is the following:
- -dpicppinstall
- -dpicpppath
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath

     * dvt101556 -
Warning numbers 7076 and 7077 for vlog and vsim  have been upgraded to suppressi
ble errors. They will now appear as:
** Error (suppressible): (<TOOL>-7076) The gcc/g++ path '<path specified>' via -
dpicppinstall swicth is not qualified and is ignored.
** Error (suppressible): (<TOOL>-7077) the path '<path specified>' via -dpicpppa
th switch not a valid gcc/g++ full path and is ignored.
vlog/vsim -suppress 7076 | 7077 to suppress the error.

     * dvt103053 - Add vlog/vopt -svinputport=compat option to default an
       input port declared with a type but without the "var" keyword to
       "wire", as required by the LRM, but only if the type is compatible
       with a net declaration. The fully LRM compliant option
       -svinputport=net will default to "wire" even if the type is not
       compatible with a net declaration ("bit", for example), potentially
       resulting in compilation errors. The default behavior remains
       unchanged, which is -svinputport=relaxed, where only a a type that
       is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single dimension vector type
       defaults to "wire".
     * dvt107371 - For implicit vopt (2-step) flow, detailed -stats output
       can now be obtained by passing required -stats=* option to
       -voptargs="" along with -vopt_verbose option in vsim.
     * dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed
       structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of
       a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
       The support has been added as default and will be an error with
       -pedanticerrors.

   SystemC Enhancements in 10.6d
     * [nodvtid] - sccom has a new option '-sctop <sc_module_name>'. This
       option should be used along with the '-nodebug' option. Every
       SystemC module specified with the
       SC_EXPORT_MODULE(<sc_module_name>) macro should be specified on the
       sccom command line with the '-sctop <sc_module_name>' option during
       compilation, e.g: sccom -sctop <top_1> -sctop <top_2> ... <other
       sccom options>.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.6d
     * dvt90645 - (results) Wildcard bins are now supported in covergroup
       crosses.
     * dvt102132 - (results) User defined function calls are now supported
       in coverpoint bin "with" expressions
     * dvt105070 - (results) Assuming that LRM has a typo on missing open
       square bracket in bin syntax, allowing coverpoint name in binrhs
       without any with-expression
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.6d
     * dvt101783 - Added "-minmerge", "-mintriage", "-mergewait", and
       "-triagewait" command-line options to vrun for fine-grained control
       of queued auto-merge function.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.6d
     * dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add"
       command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design
       elements which are inferred as registers e.g.
       regs/logic/bits/functions etc.
