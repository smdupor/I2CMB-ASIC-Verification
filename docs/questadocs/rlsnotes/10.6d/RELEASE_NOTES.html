There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

 <li>(source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be deprecated in the next major 
release 10.7 following normal deprecation process:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
suppressible error message.
<li>In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not be 
accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error message.
<li>Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed. 
This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior) which 
is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.</li>

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added a new suppressible error 7080 for the non singular condition expressions in 'if' and 'else if' statements.
For eg. 
    reg ar[5];
    if (ar)   // non singular condition
    ...
This will give suppressible error now.</li>
 <li>dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp. For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from SV files is required due to this change.
</li>
 <li>dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have been resolved.
</li>
 <li>dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints, -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple 'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver profile report by removing details that are not relevant to performance, along with the following improvements:
  - display CPU time in seconds (instead of ticks)
  - display CPU time stats for top 10 individual calls for each callsite
</li>
 <li>dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
The support has been added as default and will be an error with -pedanticerrors.  </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument. This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.</li>
 <li>dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.</li>
 <li>dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output. This has been fixed. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemC  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error. SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be recompiled with the 10.6a release.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of real types in VCD. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt90645 - (results) Wildcard bins are now supported in covergroup crosses.</li>
 <li>dvt102132 - (results) User defined function calls are now supported in coverpoint bin "with" expressions</li>
 <li>dvt105070 - (results) Assuming that LRM has a typo on missing open square bracket in bin syntax, allowing coverpoint name in binrhs without any with-expression</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add" command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design elements which are inferred as registers e.g. regs/logic/bits/functions etc. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Release Announcements Compatibility</b></font></dd>

<p /><a name="generaldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>General Defects Repaired in 10.6d</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt85852 - Added support for -autoprofile usage with -elab, -elab_cont, and -load_elab.</li>
 <li>dvt98187 - Added support for -autoprofile on a cold restore</li>
 <li>dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of real types in VCD. </li>
 <li>dvt104690 - An issue related to licensing is fixed. The issue caused a hang if the checked-out license feature is about to expire (default is 15 days before expiration). A workaround was to set the 'MGLS_EXP_WARN_DAYS' variable to '1'. Now, the workaround is not needed. This issue was not applicable to Windows platform.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6d</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt102099 - The noforce command incorrectly returns an error status when used in vsim -batch mode.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt104114 - An incorrect warning "VSIM-3581" is no longer issues when using -appendlog along with -restore or -load_elab options.</li>
 <li>dvt36562 - Using the mouse scroll wheel in the Memory View window now scrolls the window contents correctly.</li>
 <li>dvt105987 - The "change" command failed to accept variable names with index or select expressions, only in -batch mode.  This issues has bee resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt103413 - The GUI crash reading a wlf file containing SV union nets has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt107745 - GUI error occurs when trying to display FSM coverage analysis on a Task based FSM.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt107688 - In some cases, signals sent from the source window to other windows will not be from the correct scope.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

    reg ar[5];
    if (ar)   // non singular condition
    ...
This will give suppressible error now.</li>
 <li>dvt102251 - In some rare cases, randomize() would produce a solution that would violate an equality/inequality constraint between two random variables. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp. For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from SV files is required due to this change.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Questa now supports "integral_number"s as a part of an "enum_identifier" within an "enum_name_declaration" production.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - In fatal errors involving virtual interfaces Questa may have emitted an incorrect file number in the message.</li>
 <li>dvt102853 - Fixed a simulator internal error when a DPI open array with an unsized packed dimension is used. The message is similar to: 

Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error: ../../src/vsim/svdpi_runtime.c(2216). 

</li>
 <li>dvt17863 - Added support for the use of the 'array.size()' builtin function within the context of index expressions for random unpacked dynamic arrays/queues in constraints.</li>
 <li>dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.</li>
 <li>dvt101989 - In some rare cases, randomize() would generate an invalid solution when evaluating constraint expressions of the following form: "arr.sum() with (int'(item == const_val))". This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt102459 - Iterative (foreach) constraints may now specify an array parameter instead of an array variable on which to iterate.</li>
 <li>dvt102717 - In some rare cases, randomize() would ignore the 'with' clause associated with constraint expressions involving a builtin array reduction function (e.g. "foo.bar.sum() with (int'(item.baz))". This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt103611 - In some cases, randomize() scenarios involving large numbers of 'soft' constraints would solve slowly and/or fail due to memory allocation errors. Significant improvements to the constraint solver related to the evaluation of 'soft' constraints have been made, resolving these issues.</li>
 <li>dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have been resolved.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - In some cases where a fork..join block contained a nested fork..join_any sub-block, disabling the outer block would not immediately disable the inner block.</li>
 <li>dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints, -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.</li>

<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6d</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt101580 - Certain styles of continuous selected signal assignment statements with zero delay would not execute properly when optimized, either in an optimized design or a design compiled with the PE version of the product.</li>
 <li>dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument. This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.</li>
 <li>dvt103675 - In some cases where are large number of objects are declared the order of declaration could negatively impact vcom performance.</li>
 <li>dvt102732 - In some specific cases of mixed design where 'last_value was used.Simulation use to give incorrect result under -mlopt option.
This has been fixed now.</li>
 <li>dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.</li>
 <li>dvt103546 - The implicit matching operators for STD_ULOGIC, when the operands were locally static, would not be evaluated correctly by the compiler when performing an optimization to replace the expression with a known value</li>
 <li>dvt103968 - Subprogram instantiation called with out-of-range actual would sometimes not be caught as an error. </li>
 <li>dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output. This has been fixed. </li>
 <li>dvt67231 - Special characters in a comment that was inside an encrypted region could cause a parsing error.</li>
 <li>dvt106202 - An internal error was report in some cases in vcom or vopt if an array signal is indexed or sliced. The index expression or slice expression contains a locally static expression that has a primary is a record or array.  For example:
<br>
<pre>
constant C : integer_vector(0 to 1) := ( 3, 6);
signal   S : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
....
   o <= S(C(0)); -- The use of C(0) can cause an internal error
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt106288 - If a package contains a generic of the same name as a generic of an entity, and the package is instantiated within the entity, the compiler may incorrectly use the static value of the entity's generic rather than the package's generic when producing code for the package instantiation.</li>
 <li>dvt104870 - A simulator crash could occur if an object was declared with an initial expression that was the name of another object whose initial value was a function call whose return type mark was the predefined attribute SUBTYPE with a prefix that was one of the function input parameters (when that parameter is of an unconstrained composite type).</li>

Some samples previously reported as "NoContext" are now reported as "AssertionActivity" and "CoverageActivity". Samples reported as "AssertionActivity" indicate simulator time executing processes specific to assertions. The simulator combines multiple assertions into a single process when possible and it's not possible to attribute the sample to the actual process.

-add_seq_delay &lt value &gt { &lt units &gt}


Specify a constant delay value for all sequential UDPs in the design.   
 
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is zero, new delay value will be used 
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is higher, new delay value will be ignored. 
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is lower, new delay value will be replaced. 
No other structural delay will be changed with this option. 
Unit is optional, if not specified default unit will be used.

 <li>dvt78963 - Command affected: -msglimit.
Now -msglimit error -msglimitcount &lt count &gt, will stop the Questa after "count" number of errors.
-msglimit warning -msglimitcount &lt count &gt, will stop the Questa after "count" number of warnings.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Allow empty procedural case statements. I.e.: case statements with no branches defined. By default the vlog compiler will continue to emit an error when no branches are defined. This error is suppressible.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Vlog's command line option -svfilesuffix now accepts more characters as valid.</li>
 <li>dvt73654 - Added support for random variables in index expressions for both packed and unpacked arrays in constraints. The vsim option "-svrandext=randindex" can be used to enable/disable this extension. This extension is enabled by default. This extension replaces the existing extension for random variable support in index expressions for packed arrays ("-svrandext=packrandidx" is deprecated).</li>
 <li>dvt88366 - added two new options into "vcd add" command:

- "-nocell"
- "-l level"

-nocell will suppress logging into cell
-l level will be similar to the level in $dumpvar

Usage: vcd add [-file <filename>] [-dumpports] [-in] [-inout] [-internal] [-out] [-ports] [[-r] | [-r -optcells] | [-l level]] [-nocell] <item_name> ...</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Added vlog command line option to ignore System Verilog keyword and treat them as identifiers under option -ignoresvkeywords="keyword1[,keyword2]".</li>
 <li>dvt103176 - <p>
Constraint solver vsim switch -solvefailseverity has been enhanced. The error message for randomize() failure and randomize(null) failure can be controlled separately with different severities. The existing usage of -solvefailseverity is not impacted. 

<p>
-solvefailseverity=&lt;value1&gt;[&lt;value2&gt;]
<pre>
   Specify error message severity when randomize() and randomize(null) failures are detected.
   When both &lt;value1&gt; and &lt;value2&gt; are present, &lt;value1&gt; specifies the severity of randomize(),
   and &lt;value2&gt; specifies the severity for randomize(null). When only &lt;value1&gt; is present, the
   severity setting applies to both randomize() and randomize(null).
   Valid values for both &lt;value1&gt; and  &lt;value2&gt;:
      0 - no error
      1 - warning
      2 - error
      3 - failure
      4 - fatal
</pre>
<p>
The companion modelsim.ini variable has been enhanced for the similar change. 
</li>
 <li>dvt5888 - Questa now supports reading vector based port declarations in evcd file. The option to read this file is -vcdstim which is an existing option. There is no additional option needed to use this functionality. Vector based evcd file can be generated from Questa using +dumpports+collapse option.</li>
 <li>dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver profile report by removing details that are not relevant to performance, along with the following improvements:
  - display CPU time in seconds (instead of ticks)
  - display CPU time stats for top 10 individual calls for each callsite
</li>
 <li>dvt100019 - Added SystemVerilog extension to improve support for function calls in constraints with complex interactions between the function input(s) and function output by allowing functions to be called multiple times. Specify vsim command line option "-svrandext=funcback" to enable this extension.</li>
 <li>dvt99791 - For C/C++ auto compile, modelsim.ini variable "DpiCppInstall" has been added which is the equivalent of the '-dpicppinstall' command line option.</li>
 <li>dvt99791 - <pre>
The '-cppinstall' and '-cpppath' options will be honored for C/C++ auto compile in the absence of '-dpicppinstall' and '-dpicpppath' options.
For SystemC compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path is the following:
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath
For C/C++ auto compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path is the following:
- -dpicppinstall
- -dpicpppath
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath
</pre></li>
 <li>dvt101556 - <pre>
Warning numbers 7076 and 7077 for vlog and vsim  have been upgraded to suppressible errors. They will now appear as:
** Error (suppressible): (&lt;TOOL&gt;-7076) The gcc/g++ path '&lt;path specified&gt;' via -dpicppinstall swicth is not qualified and is ignored.
** Error (suppressible): (&lt;TOOL&gt;-7077) the path '&lt;path specified&gt;' via -dpicpppath switch not a valid gcc/g++ full path and is ignored.
vlog/vsim -suppress 7076 | 7077 to suppress the error.
</pre></li>
 <li>dvt103053 - Add vlog/vopt -svinputport=compat option to default an input port declared with a type but without the "var" keyword to "wire", as required by the LRM, but only if the type is compatible with a net declaration. The fully LRM compliant option -svinputport=net will default to "wire" even if the type is not compatible with a net declaration ("bit", for example), potentially resulting in compilation errors. The default behavior remains unchanged, which is -svinputport=relaxed, where only a a type that is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single dimension vector type defaults to "wire".</li>
 <li>dvt107371 - For implicit vopt (2-step) flow, detailed -stats output can now be obtained by passing required -stats=* option to -voptargs="" along with -vopt_verbose option in vsim. </li>
 <li>dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
The support has been added as default and will be an error with -pedanticerrors.  </li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - sccom has a new option '-sctop &lt;sc_module_name&gt;'. This option should be used along with the '-nodebug' option. Every SystemC module specified with the SC_EXPORT_MODULE(&lt;sc_module_name&gt;) macro should be specified on the sccom command line with the '-sctop &lt;sc_module_name&gt;' option during compilation, e.g: sccom -sctop &lt;top_1&gt; -sctop &lt;top_2&gt; ... &lt;other sccom options&gt;.
