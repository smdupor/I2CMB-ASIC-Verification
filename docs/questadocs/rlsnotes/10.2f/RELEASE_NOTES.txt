   Release Announcements in 10.2f
     * [nodvtid] -
       In 10.3, support for Linux RHEL 4 will be discontinued.
       In 10.4, support for Windows XP and Windows Vista will be
       discontinued.
       [10.2d] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.2d] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.2f

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt65714 - (results) When "+vlog_retain_same2same_on" was
       specified, conditional specify paths with SDF RETAIN delays did not
       evaluate correctly.
     * dvt68824 - (results) Calling vpi_get_time function with a VPI
       handle of wrong type (for example to a package) would cause vsim to
       crash.
     * dvt68543 - (results) Setting acc on an instance wasn't setting it
       on the ports of the instance. This could result in ports tied to
       constants being shared, so that a force on one would cause the
       others to be forced as well.
     * dvt69309 - (results) Fixed bug in single bit multiplication which
       resulted in wrong simulation results.
     * dvt37478 - (results) Fixed an issue where $display incorrectly
       shows a zero length string if the input string is assigned the
       value of a foldable ternary expression containing string literals
       as implicant and alternate.
     * dvt36062 - (results) Fixed an issue where string method getc
       incorrectly returns an extra space.
     * dvt35070 - (results) Vsim used to report illegal results when a
       part select of more than 32 bits size on a hierarchical reference
       of a net is forced using verilog force. This is now fixed.
     * dvt69036 - (results) vpi_get_value used to report junk values with
       greater than 32 bits constant values. This is now fixed.
     * dvt35989 - (results) Assignment to an uninitialised dynamic string
       array using concatenation did not work properly. The following case
       did not work : string arr[int] = '{default: ""}; arr[10] = {arr[10]
       , " " , "test"}; This has been fixed.
     * dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values
       were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values,
       vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.
     * dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port
       driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays
       and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and
       -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an
       uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either
       through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer
       designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing
       symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to
       either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of
       the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * dvt72760 - (results) In a mixed language design with a verilog
       switch network the extended VCD output for a VHDL signal was not
       calculated properly.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt31491 - (results) Now SV Enum types would be corrupted from
       their base value instead of their `left value.
       Example :
       typedef enum bit unsigned [31:0] { ONE=1, TWO,THREE} enum_t3;
       The new corruption value for above type would be "0" instead of
       "ONE(1)".

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt68772 - (results) When a duplicate covergroup instance name is
       specified in the source code, the simulator by default will issue a
       warning and then automatically generate a unique name to resolve
       the conflict. When vsim option -pedanticerrors is used, the
       duplicate name will trigger a fatal error.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt75521 - (results) Fixed a defect that caused statement coverage
       to be skipped when statement coverage was explicitly selected along
       with other coverage types. This effect many of the "coverage ..."
       command supporting the "-code ..." argument. EXAMPLE ARGUMENT:
       "-code st".

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.2f
     * dvt68249 - UVM testbench with scopes containing special characters
       cause errors and fail to display contents of these scopes. This
       issue has been resolved.
     * dvt26963 - Drag and drop a compare object from the compare tab in
       the Structure window to the List window did not work. This has been
       repaired.
     * dvt38385 - In GUI mode, using the restore command outside of vsim
       caused uninformative error "can't read "vsimPriv(Server)": no such
       element in array" and would cause eventual GUI crash.
     * dvt69259 - In some rare cases the GUI would hang when
       right-clicking on a signal in the Source Window. Depending on the
       specific hierarchy of the design an infinite loop would occur when
       checking conditions to enable/disable the items in the RMB menu.
     * dvt38562 - The context and locals windows will sometimes stop
       working correctly when stopping and single stepping in code related
       to dynamic threads. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt63858 - Toggling the "Within Cells" mode of the Memory List
       window while a search filter is in use can cause the display of an
       incomplete list of memories. This issues has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.2f
     * dvt65714 - (results) When "+vlog_retain_same2same_on" was
       specified, conditional specify paths with SDF RETAIN delays did not
       evaluate correctly.
     * dvt68271 - Fixed a bug where vopt was crashing due to usage of
       $past in the port connection. This was happening when the second
       argument to $past (number of clock ticks) was explicitly specified.
     * dvt68672 - Fixed a bug where internal error vtree_dt2.c(8285)
       &lttdef && typeof(tdef) == TYPEDEF_DECL && line_numberOf(tdef) ==
       lineno && tok_numberOf(tdef) == tokno>. was getting issued in vopt.
       Now, no internal error is issued.
     * dvt64800 - Vsim would sometimes give an erroneous error 8876
       ("Rerun vopt with -novifassumptions...").
     * dvt68824 - (results) Calling vpi_get_time function with a VPI
       handle of wrong type (for example to a package) would cause vsim to
       crash.
     * dvt68823 - Fixed an invalid memory access issue, related to pruning
       of ACT graph, in solver.
     * dvt68543 - (results) Setting acc on an instance wasn't setting it
       on the ports of the instance. This could result in ports tied to
       constants being shared, so that a force on one would cause the
       others to be forced as well.
     * dvt68059 - Foreach iteration on a queue defined in a parameterized
       class would sometimes result in incorrect error. This has been
       fixed now.
     * dvt68292 - A constant declared inside a package when used in a port
       map would sometime results in a vopt crash. This is now fixed.
     * dvt69038 - Array defined in parameterized class when indexed with
       an index of type 'byte' would sometime give incorrect results. This
       has been fixed now.
     * dvt68778 - Vsim would sometimes generate incorrect errors like this
       for code in SystemVerilog packages:
       # ** Error: (vsim-3043) test.sv(-2): Unresolved reference to 'a'.
     * dvt36943 - Fixed an issue where vopt crashes when +acc is specified
       to an incorrect path starting with a verilog configuration name.
     * dvt64934 - Fixed an issue where we would get unresolved reference
       errors for hier-refs accessing objects within an generate loop and
       +floatparameters is used.
     * dvt65907 - Fixed a fatal error in vsim, which occurs sometimes when
       a module containing a for loop but works when compiled with -sv.
     * dvt68960 - Fixed an issue in SV bind doesn't work, when bind target
       lies within an generate scope which can't be elaborated during
       vopt.
     * dvt69309 - (results) Fixed bug in single bit multiplication which
       resulted in wrong simulation results.
     * dvt36672 - Generate case statement without a default clause would
       sometime results in vopt crash. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt69804 - Fixed bug which resulted in incorrect vlog errors when
       $signed/$unsigned cast operation is used inside concatenation.
     * dvt69513 - Fixed a bug in for-generates which resulted in wrong
       vlog errors when enum literals are used in genvar initialization.
     * dvt69393 - Fixed a bug which was giving error when string parameter
       was used in argument of system call $readmemh
     * dvt67602 - Fixed an issue where unconnected_drive pull1 was not
       working with vopt.
     * dvt38331 - Fixed a bug where post increment operator on an argument
       of function of type byte was causing memory corruption.
     * dvt22670 - In some cases with inline randomization constraints,
       vlog incorrectly reported an error like:
       ** Error: pkg.sv(39): Can't use a typedef ('my_enum_t') here.
       with the usage of a valid type name.
     * dvt62517 - Recursive static functions would sometimes return
       incorrect value. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt68198 - Fixed an issue where invoking a static method of a
       renamed class causes vlog error
     * dvt38148 - Fixed an issue where a parameterized class object in a
       nested program scope does not get resolved by vopt
     * dvt37478 - (results) Fixed an issue where $display incorrectly
       shows a zero length string if the input string is assigned the
       value of a foldable ternary expression containing string literals
       as implicant and alternate.
     * dvt36062 - (results) Fixed an issue where string method getc
       incorrectly returns an extra space.
     * dvt64128 - Fixed a bug while assigning interfaces with similar
       starting name. For example my_itf_chk and my_itf.master.
     * dvt35070 - (results) Vsim used to report illegal results when a
       part select of more than 32 bits size on a hierarchical reference
       of a net is forced using verilog force. This is now fixed.
     * dvt69036 - (results) vpi_get_value used to report junk values with
       greater than 32 bits constant values. This is now fixed.
     * dvt35989 - (results) Assignment to an uninitialised dynamic string
       array using concatenation did not work properly. The following case
       did not work : string arr[int] = '{default: ""}; arr[10] = {arr[10]
       , " " , "test"}; This has been fixed.
     * dvt70147 - Fixed an issue where we get "(vsim-3043) Unresolved
       reference" errors for hier-refs present in the $unit scope and
       target of the hier-ref is present inside another design top. With
       +acc flags on the target object the error goes away.
     * dvt70053 - Fixed issue while converting verilog package to vhdl
       package with mixedsvvh switch.
     * dvt70463 - Vopt would sometimes crash with an internal error when
       using a class typedef defined in a parameterized class. This has
       been fixed now.
     * dvt38055 - Vopt would sometimes crash with an internal error when
       passing the parameter of a parameterized class as a parameter to
       another parameterized class. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt67652 - Vopt would sometimes crash with an internal error when a
       function defined in a package is used with array locator method.
       This has been fixed now.
     * dvt71152 - Bit-selects and part-selects of 2-state variables in
       module input port connections produced incorrect results in some
       cases.
     * dvt69512 - A function call in one of the bounds of a part-select
       produced the following vopt internal error in some cases: "Questa
       has encountered an unexpected internal error:
       ../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(114)".
     * dvt71073 - Automatic function defined in package would sometimes
       gives incorrect return value. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt72524 - Fixed a bug where parameter inside super class was not
       found while resolving hierref in bind statement.
     * dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values
       were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values,
       vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.
     * dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port
       driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays
       and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and
       -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.
     * dvt73310 - Traversing individual words of large SV memories using
       vpi_iterate/vpi_scan functions caused huge memory usage.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.2f
     * dvt69541 - A compiler optimization was incorrectly generating code
       for constants initialized with the concatenation operator (&)
       appearing in subprogram declarations of uninstantiated packages.
     * dvt70898 - Use of the function rising_edge and falling_edge could,
       in some case, trigger an internal error
     * dvt71805 - In rare cases, simulating with -novopt would give the
       wrong results for a std_logic_vector unless it was logged.
     * dvt72143 - If an uninstantiated package contains signal
       declarations, and an instance of the package is associated with an
       interface package in an entity, package, or subprogram
       instantiation, accesses to the signals could lead to simulator
       error messages of the form:
# ** INTERNAL ERROR: pkgref: export lookup failed for package #8[7]

     * dvt73051 - Fixed elaboration crash with subelement association. The
       formal must be an element or subelement of a multidimensional port
       and the actually a 2008 signal expression.
     * dvt72382 - Optimized mode was not reporting multiply driven
       unresolved signals in rare instances of driving package signals.
     * [nodvtid] - Aggregates of signals in subprograms, either as
       parameters to other subprogram, or as targets of signal assignments
       could cause a crash if the aggregate contained both parameters and
       non-parameter signals.
     * dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an
       uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either
       through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer
       designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing
       symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to
       either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of
       the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.
     * dvt74124 - Vcom could fail with an internal error when a port map
       statement is present on a block
     * dvt74313 - If an attribute that returned a range is used as the
       expression to a return statement, incorrect machine code could be
       generated. A range is not a valid return value and is now flagged
       as an error a compile time.
     * dvt63309 - In some cases vopt would generate a unexpected message
       about null ranges. Like:
       # ** Warning: [3] test.vhd(3): (vopt-1246) Range 1 to 0 is null.
       The number of these messages have been greatly reduced.
     * dvt71451 - Predefined attribute A'ELEMENT could not have as its
       prefix a function call. The LRM is not clear on this since A must
       be either an array type name or appropriate for an array object,
       and a function call is neither. But because other attributes like
       A'RANGE where A is a function call are handled as legal, the
       A'ELEMENT attribute now also allows this. Further, as a
       non-compliant extension of the language O'SUBTYPE may also have O
       be a function call.
     * dvt74843 - The compiler would hang if it encountered a VHDL error
       involving a type declaration of an array type whose element subtype
       is an incomplete type of the same name as the array type itself.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.2f
     * [nodvtid] - Hierarchical references from Verilog to fields of a
       VHDL record signal could cause the tool to fail.
     * dvt38882 - When the file permissions on a library of encrypted
       Verilog cells was closed, the VHDL compiler would error out because
       it could not get Verilog to generate an interface file to compile
       against.
     * dvt72760 - (results) In a mixed language design with a verilog
       switch network the extended VCD output for a VHDL signal was not
       calculated properly.

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.2f
     * dvt75521 - (results) Fixed a defect that caused statement coverage
       to be skipped when statement coverage was explicitly selected along
       with other coverage types. This effect many of the "coverage ..."
       command supporting the "-code ..." argument. EXAMPLE ARGUMENT:
       "-code st".

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.2f
     * dvt68936 - Enable level shifter instantiated in the design was
       associated with a UPF isolation strategy as its -instance cell even
       when the connection to the level_shifter_enable_pin did not match
       with the one specified in the UPF isolation strategy. This has been
       fixed.
     * dvt69442 - There was a liberty processing failure when when index_1
       was defined in the define group and was also used in the dc_current
       group. This is now fixed.
     * dvt70250 - In some cases, vopt used to crash when UPF processing
       was performed on a signal assignment involving vector write on VHDL
       records. This has been fixed.
     * dvt31491 - (results) Now SV Enum types would be corrupted from
       their base value instead of their `left value.
       Example :
       typedef enum bit unsigned [31:0] { ONE=1, TWO,THREE} enum_t3;
       The new corruption value for above type would be "0" instead of
       "ONE(1)".

   General Enhancements in 10.2f
     * dvt71032 - Following design constructs are now supported in
       QuestaSim bsaif flow with "power add" and "power report" commands
       1. VHDL integers 2. System Verilog 2D arrays (packed and unpacked)
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.2f
     * dvt68221 - Added $unpacked_dimensions() array query function
       support.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Enhancements in 10.2f
     * dvt67502 - Added -gblso command option to vopt and the companion
       modelsim.ini variable 'GlobalSharedObjectList'
-gblso       Load the specified shared library with global symbol visibility.

       This option would be required if the SystemC top is elaborated in
       vopt and is depending on the symbols from a common library being
       loaded with vsim -gblso switch.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Enhancements in 10.2f
     * dvt69212 - Fixed an issue when a module is instantiated inside a
       VHDL entity and the module's port name matches with a parameter of
       a module instantiated within the current module.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.2f
     * dvt68772 - (results) When a duplicate covergroup instance name is
       specified in the source code, the simulator by default will issue a
       warning and then automatically generate a unique name to resolve
       the conflict. When vsim option -pedanticerrors is used, the
       duplicate name will trigger a fatal error.
