   Key Information
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1 or 2019.2 or
       2019.3 or 2019.4. However, if you are migrating to 2019.4 from a
       release like 10.6 and older, please note that release 2019.4 uses
       FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
     * The Register Assistant version included within this release has
       been upgraded to RUVM/2019.4.
       RUVM/2019.4 is a native 64-bit application.

   Release Announcements in 2019.4
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

     * Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have
       discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to
       support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until
       their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid
       2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 2019.4

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-55788 - (results) Module instances under for-generate blocks
       are not initialized with same initialization seed, which can result
       in non-LRM compliant simulation behavior. A SystemVerilog
       constrained-random language extension "genmodseedfix" has been
       implemented to address this issue. To enable LRM-compliant seeding
       of module instances under for-generate blocks, add
       "-svrandext=+genmodseedfix" to the vsim command line. This
       extension is enabled by default.
     * QSIM-59880 - (results) In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly
       evaluate a 'soft' constraint containing an indexed expression with
       a random index. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-59050 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() calls
       involving constraints with function calls (having one or more
       arguments) would be incorrectly evaluated (sometimes resulting in
       spurious constraint contradiction failures). This issue has been
       resolved.
     * QSIM-58384 - (results) Significantly improved performance and
       reduced memory usage related to evaluation of randomize() calls
       involving large numbers of 'inside' constraint expressions.
     * QSIM-56092 - (results) Significant improvements to how randomize()
       calls involving constraints with 'real' type operands are evaluated
       have been implemented with regard to correctness/repeatability,
       precision, solution distribution, and performance. Randomization of
       'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real
       Number Modeling (svrnm) license.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-58539 - (results) The attributes INSTANCE_NAME and PATH_NAME,
       were not considered globally static. If the prefix of the attribute
       is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an
       on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a
       change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or
       concurrent statement. This currently results in extra statement
       executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so
       the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that
       prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different
       from previous versions.
     * QSIM-57969 - (results) Using a function call without arguments in a
       generic map was showing syntax error incorrectly. This has been
       fixed.

   General Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) For constrained random stimulus,
       random results for a given seed are consistent across all platforms
       and variants of platforms.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 2019.4
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed a crash where forcing a modport item was causing
       crash in access flow. This results in an error message now.
     * [nodvtid] - vmake many now consume less memory.
     * QSIM-55252 - The vdir command can now be given the name of an
       already-existing directory; it will transform the directory into a
       Questa library. The directory must be empty for this to succeed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2019.4
     * [nodvtid] - Vlog would crash when parsing certain syntax
       constructs.
     * QSIM-58023 - Using a wire type with a struct containing a field of
       an enum type could generate an error like<br>
       <code># ** Fatal: (vsim-3355) Variable 'struct1.enum1' cannot be
       converted to a net.</code>
     * [nodvtid] - SystemVerilog macros undefining and subsequently
       redefining a macro of the same name repeatedly during macro
       expansion would generate incorrect results.
     * QSIM-58670 - Vsim incorrectly reported a vsim-3837 error for
       multiple continuous assignments to a variable when using a
       bit-select expression with a complex index expression
     * QSIM-55788 - (results) Module instances under for-generate blocks
       are not initialized with same initialization seed, which can result
       in non-LRM compliant simulation behavior. A SystemVerilog
       constrained-random language extension "genmodseedfix" has been
       implemented to address this issue. To enable LRM-compliant seeding
       of module instances under for-generate blocks, add
       "-svrandext=+genmodseedfix" to the vsim command line. This
       extension is enabled by default.
     * QSIM-60156 - In some rare cases, randomize() would return 0
       indicating no solutions for constraints involving signed modulo
       expressions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-59957 - In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving an
       array.sum() constraint with a 'with' clause within the context of
       an iterative constraint would trigger an internal error. This issue
       has been fixed.
     * QSIM-59880 - (results) In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly
       evaluate a 'soft' constraint containing an indexed expression with
       a random index. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-59116 - Significantly improved performance of randomize()
       calls involving large numbers of 'randc' variables.
     * QSIM-59051 - In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving
       constraints with function calls (having one or more arguments)
       would trigger an internal error. This issue has been resolved.
     * QSIM-59050 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() calls
       involving constraints with function calls (having one or more
       arguments) would be incorrectly evaluated (sometimes resulting in
       spurious constraint contradiction failures). This issue has been
       resolved.
     * QSIM-58871 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause the
       simulator to crash when evaluating constraints involving a
       non-random multi-dimensional packed array. This issue has been
       fixed.
     * QSIM-58384 - (results) Significantly improved performance and
       reduced memory usage related to evaluation of randomize() calls
       involving large numbers of 'inside' constraint expressions.
     * QSIM-58334 - Attempting to randomize() a protected (encrypted)
       class containing a static random variable would cause a crash or
       trigger an error (vsim-7180). This issue has been resolved, and
       randomize() calls on protected classes w/ static random variables
       are now supported.
     * QSIM-59820 - In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving
       constraints having function calls will spuriously fail with the
       error: "(vsim-7090) Invalid X or Z in a state expression value
       within a constraint." This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-60117 - In some rare cases, randomize() calls referring to one
       or more 'soft dist' constraints would cause a spurious failure (no
       solutions). This issue has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 2019.4
     * QSIM-57546 - If a package contains a package instance within a USE
       clause, static array constraints within the package instance may
       not be compiled correctly, possible causing a fatal internal error
       during elaboration of the design by the simulator.
     * QSIM-57795 - The compiler could report a fatal internal error if it
       encountered a generic declaration list with an index constraint
       within a generic vector preceding an interface package.
     * QSIM-58539 - (results) The attributes INSTANCE_NAME and PATH_NAME,
       were not considered globally static. If the prefix of the attribute
       is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an
       on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a
       change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or
       concurrent statement. This currently results in extra statement
       executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so
       the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that
       prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different
       from previous versions.
     * QSIM-57830 - Using unconstrained alias signal as an actual for a
       port connection was leading to a crash. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-57969 - (results) Using a function call without arguments in a
       generic map was showing syntax error incorrectly. This has been
       fixed.
     * QSIM-60023 - Use of the -mixedsvvh switch could result in the
       compiler erroneously emitting error vcom-1995, which states that a
       package cannot be imported into SystemVerilog designs. This can
       occur when at least two VHDL packages are compiled on a single
       command-line with the -mixedsvvh switch; and, one package contains
       a constant declaration initialized by a function defined in the
       other package, and the name of the first package comes lexically
       before the name of the second package.
     * QSIM-57712 - If an entity has a generic whose type depends on a
       previously declared generic and that entity is directly
       instantiated, then vsim could crash when loading the design. The
       work around was to use a component instantiation.
     * QSIM-60153 - If a component had a port that is a multi-dimensional
       array whose bounds depended on the component's generics and the
       port's actual was an expression, vcom could generate an internal
       error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 2019.4
     * VM-8461 - Fixed bug in VRM testlist expansion where multiple test
       lines with same test name were not being clubbed into a single
       block of runnable instances.
     * QSIMQA-3564 - Fixed bug in VRM status command (vrun -status) where
       merged coverage could be incorrect depending on how tests are
       grouped for auto-merge
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 2019.4
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) For constrained random stimulus,
       random results for a given seed are consistent across all platforms
       and variants of platforms.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 2019.4
     * QSIM-55884 - Constraint expressions involving division of 'real'
       type operands are now supported during randomize() when the
       "realrand" SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default).
       Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a
       SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.
     * QSIM-57834 - Distribution constraints involving 'real' type
       operands are now supported during randomize() when the "realrand"
       SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default). Randomization of
       'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real
       Number Modeling (svrnm) license.If the RHS of a 'dist' constraint
       specifies a 'real' type range (e.g. "[1.4:2.5]") then an explicit
       weight must be specified (implicit default weight of ":= 1" is not
       supported) and only the ":/" weight operator is supported (the ":="
       is not supported for ranges); in addition, the probability for
       selecting a single value from the specified range is undefined.
       'real' types are not supported for 'dist' weight expressions.
     * QSIM-58007 - When -solveverbose or -solveinfo is specified on the
       vsim command line, the solver will dump information about the
       constraints which participate in a given randomize() call. In some
       cases, constraints which contain references to non-random variables
       would display the names of the variables and not the value of those
       variables, making it difficult to debug issues related to those
       constraints. The -solveverbose/-solveinfo output for these kinds of
       constraints has been improved -- now the value of non-random
       variables and the names of those variables (as an in-line comment)
       are displayed.
     * QSIM-58407 - Implemented a new feature "RNG Trace" that produces
       diagnostic output during simulation to assist in the analysis of
       random-stability issues between two differing simulations. Enable
       RNG tracing by adding "-rngtrace" to the vsim command line. For
       additional details and options, refer to the Questa SIM Command
       Reference Manual (options "-rngtrace", "-rngtraceopt",
       "-rngtraceclassfilter", "-rngtraceprocessfilter") and the
       "Simulator State Variables" Section of the Questa SIM User's Manual
       (variables "RNGTrace", "RNGTraceFile", "RNGTraceOpt",
       "RNGTraceClassFilter", "RNGTraceProcessFilter")
     * QSIM-59275 - Given a randomize() scenario with no solutions, when
       -solvefaildebug is enabled, a constraint contradiction report is
       generated representing the minimum-set of contradictory
       constraints. If a timeout occurred during the determination of the
       minimum-set, the error message "(vsim-7175) randomize() failed due
       to a non-reproducible constraint conflict." was displayed. This
       error message was found to be confusing and has been improved. The
       new error message that is displayed when a timeout occurs during
       -solvefaildebug minimum-set generation is: "(vsim-7097) Timeout
       while testing for -solvefaildebug constraint conflicts
       (SolveFailDebugTimeout=50)."
     * QSIM-56092 - (results) Significant improvements to how randomize()
       calls involving constraints with 'real' type operands are evaluated
       have been implemented with regard to correctness/repeatability,
       precision, solution distribution, and performance. Randomization of
       'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real
       Number Modeling (svrnm) license.
     * QSIM-59852 - Given a randomize() scenario with no solutions, when
       -solvefaildebug is enabled, a constraint contradiction report is
       generated representing the minimum-set of contradictory
       constraints. If a timeout occurred during the determination of the
       minimum-set, an error message was displayed and no constraint
       contradiction report (or testcase when -solvefailtestcase is
       specified) would be generated. This behavior has changed -- if a
       timeout now occurs during -solvefaildebug minimum-set generation,
       then a partial constraint contradiction report (and partial
       testcase) will be generated. The partial results may provide enough
       information to assist in debugging the constraint contradiction.
