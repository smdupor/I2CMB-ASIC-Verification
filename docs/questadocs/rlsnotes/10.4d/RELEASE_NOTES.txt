     * [nodvtid] -
       [10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been
       discontinued.
       [10.4] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.
       However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4d

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt80536 - (source) It is not permitted to change the protected
       status of an existing design unit by recompiling it, it must be
       deleted from the library and then recompiled.
     * dvt76032 - (source) Reseeding simulation: Added a new VSIM command
       "sv_reseed " which will re-seed every SystemVerilog random number
       generator (thread objects, class objects) based on the specified
       seed (or "random", which will select a random seed). This feature
       can be used after a "vsim -restore" (or at any time) to modify the
       behavior of SystemVerilog random constructs (randomize, randcase,
       randsequence, $urandom, etc) from the point the "sv_reseed" command
       is issued forward. NOTE: There is a small performance impact (both
       speed and memory) on a simulation that has been reseeded.
       Restarting simulation with a new seed: The VSIM command "restart"
       now accepts a "-sv_seed " option, which will restart the simulation
       with the specified seed value (or "random", which will select a
       random seed). Previously, the "set Sv_Seed " command was used
       immediately before a "restart" to instruct Questa to restart
       simulation with a different seed -- this is no longer allowed (the
       "Sv_Seed" variable is now read-only).
     * dvt81854 - (source) Added control options to alter the behavior of
       certain constraints during randomize() to generate significant
       differences in solution distribution. The options are controlled
       via the "vsim -svrandext" command line option:
       -svrandext=[+|-][,[+|-]]* Enable/disable non-LRM compliant
       SystemVerilog constrained-random language extensions Valid
       extensions are: nonrandstab - disable seeding of "non-random" class
       instances promotedist - promote priority of 'dist' constraint if
       LHS has no solve/before nodist - interpret 'dist' constraint as
       'inside' (ACT only) noorder - ignore solve/before ordering
       constraints (ACT only) skew - skew randomize results (ACT only) The
       new options are "nodist" and "noorder". The other options
       (nonrandstab, promotedist, skew) were previously set via the "vsim
       -svext" command line option, and have been moved to "-svrandext"
       (all SystemVerilog constrained-random related options are now
       grouped under "-svrandext"). Note that "nodist", "noorder", and
       "skew" only apply to the ACT solver engine.
     * dvt79521 - (source, results) If a macro is defined using the
       +define command line option, it will override all `undefs in the
       RTL code, ie, `undef for that macro will be ignored. For backward
       compatibility, the switch -nooverrideundef has been added. If a
       macro is defined using +define command line option, and
       -nooverrideundef is also passed as a compile option, the `undef
       will be honored for that macro.
     * dvt83328 - (source, results) A new svext switch -svext=arif (allow
       ref in fork) was added to support use of refs in fork-join_any or
       fork-join_none blocks inside tasks. Use of refs in fork-join_any
       and fork-join_none blocks is an error by default.
     * dvt79480 - (results) Fixed a bug which results in reversed bit
       connections, when a concat expression is passed to an unpacked port
     * dvt78775 - (results) Under certain circumstances, use of "++" or
       "--" as an index into an array would result in the variable being
       incremented or decremented 2-3 times, instead of just once.
     * dvt79543 - (results) Fixed an issue that would cause randomize() to
       return 0 for some non-contradictory scenarios involving a single
       4-state random variable and a single 'dist' constraint.
     * dvt79679 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would generate
       differing results for a fully optimized simulation vs. a simulation
       where +acc is enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt73180 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() will produce
       spurious results for random variables involved in a !inside
       (not-inside) constraint if the LHS and RHS contain random
       variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt80596 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger
       an internal error in slvACTContext. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt81155 - (results) In some situations a release on a register
       which had a force in effect fails to trigger a continuous
       assignment to that register.
     * dvt81118 - (results) The 'index()' method, when used inside a
       nested array manipulation method, would return the wrong value.
     * dvt77481 - (results) Fixed cascaded sequential UDP issue. New
       behavior is more aggressive in finding cascaded SUDP and handling
       them.
     * dvt80469 - (results) Fixed a bug in handling of an assign statement
       inside a for-loop in verilog. Was already working in SV flow.
     * dvt82348 - (results) Fixed the parsing errors related to empty
       clocking event field in $past and similar calls. LRM allows giving
       empty arguments to these calls.
     * dvt82422 - (results) Fixed an assert failure when there is a
       part-select on an element of a packed struct in the RHS of an
       assign statement.
     * dvt82551 - (results) Fixed an assert failure in vopt where
       out-of-bounds index of a vector is being used in a concatenation.
     * dvt75654 - (results) SDF back-annotation now works with anonymous
       Non-ansi type source and destination ports.
     * dvt83309 - (results) Under an 'always @(*)', an external reference
       with a non-constant index was not properly being added to the
       sensitivity list. An example woule be 'my_if.data.info[i].id',
       where 'i' is a variable. Now, 'my_if.data.info' will trigger the
       always block.
     * dvt82483 - (results) Added a new SystemVerilog Constraint Solver
       extension, -svrandext=[+|-]forkjoinstab. By default this extension
       is disabled. When this extension is enabled, the random stability
       of parent thread is preserved when creating the fork/join
       sub-threads.
     * dvt82697 - (results) Within the context of a constraint, allow a
       random index expression for any packed variable (previously, this
       was only allowed on scalar packed variables). This non-LRM
       compliant extension is enabled by default, and can be disabled with
       "vsim -svrandext=-randpackidx" or with "vsim -pedanticerrors".
     * dvt78261 - (results) Changed the way vsim interprets invalid
       Sv_Seed values (passed in via the vsim "-sv_seed" command line
       option or the "Sv_Seed" modelsim.ini variable). In the past, when
       vsim encountered an invalid Sv_Seed value, an non-suppressible
       error message (vsim-7031) would be displayed and Sv_Seed would be
       set to 0. The new behavior allows the error to be
       downgraded/suppressed, and the value of Sv_Seed will reflect the
       32-bit truncated value of the invalid seed (the interpreted value
       of Sv_Seed will be displayed by the vsim-7031 error message).
     * dvt82275 - (results) The "vsim -sv_reseed" command line option and
       the VSIM "sv_reseed" command are now UVM aware by default (requires
       questa_uvm_pkg 1.2.3) -- when a UVM simulation is re-seeded, the
       random sequences generated by UVM will change as a result. This
       behavior can be disabled with "vsim -uvmcontrol=-reseed".

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt75261 - (source) If a locally static range of the first form
       (A'RANGE or A'REVERSE_RANGE) was used as the index range in an
       array subtype indication, there was no check that the range bounds
       were compatible with the index subtype of the base array type. This
       has been fixed.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) vcover parallelmerge has following changes:
- Added new options: -32, -64, -log
- Added support for UGE & RTDA grid type
- Changed behavior of -outname option. parallelmerge will now create output file
 with exact given name. It will no longer append '.ucdb' in UCDB mode
- Added support to specify multiple directory paths to -genlistfrom in UCDB mode

     * dvt78215 - (results) Nested protected blocks causing unexpected
       coverage disable on some of the modules in the concerned hierarchy.
     * dvt78216 - (results) Protected module causing coverage disable of
       other modules in presence of -mfcu.
     * dvt79569 - (results) FEC expression and condition coverage numbers
       were different in byfile coverage report and GUI Files tab.
     * dvt76485 - (results) In coverage html reports, exclusion comments
       added by the users is added as a tooltip in the hit count cells.
       Also, a plus sign '+' is added in the cell to indicate that this
       cell has an exclusion comment.
     * dvt79285 - (results) In the coverage summary page in html coverage
       report, a new hyperlink named "List of Design Units included in
       report..." is added. When clicked,it will redirect the user to a
       new html page that has a table containing all the design units and
       the coverage percentages for all the available coverage types in
       the design. This table can be sorted by either the total coverage
       or any of the coverage types.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Following enhancements were added to vcover
       parallelmerge:
- Show correct memory with -stats=perf and total number of error/warning counts.
- Show runtime and memory consumed by each parallel merge process
- Show merge errors and warnings by default
- Deprecated -verbose=all mode
- Added -quiet and -verbose mode
- Show parallelmerge command in vcover -help
- Added extra check if merge process gets killed by grid
- Added version number in internally generated RMDB file. If user had copied RMD
B file and modified to support their grid, they will need to update their RMDB f
ile for these new enhancements.

     * dvt28804 - (results) The -checkinputs switch is added in vcover
       merge to skip and report corrupted UCDB input files.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt80233 - (source, results) A new VOPT checks-controllability
       option is added that shall enable/disable specified dynamic PA
       check based on the control-signal-expression value. Option:
       [-chksctrl_expr {ctrl-signal-expression}] Sample tcl commands to
       achieve ctrl-signal-expression based controllability: pa_checks
       -checkIds { rpo rop} -chksctrl_expr {/tb/retpwr && /tb/rtc}
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There was some noise in -pa_checks=t
       (QPA_PD_OFF_ACT) during power domain transitioning. This issue has
       been fixed now.
     * dvt79862 - (results) Fixed an issue in master-slave(also known as
       slave-alive) retention configuration. Now when the retention
       condition is active then the effect of clock, set or reset is
       ignored and the retained value is present at the register output.

   General Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There are multiple VPI changes to the class
       model to align it more closely to the LRM, and to make it more
       useable. Class object names are now aligned to the GUI names. More
       vpi_handle and vpi_iterate queries have been implemented, affecting
       among other things vpiClassTypespec, vpiClassObj, and vpiClassDefn
       objects. Queries for file and line information on class objects
       will return an error, as these objects are not anchored by
       definition to the source code.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt81937 - (results) xml2ucdb fails to replace parameters with
       their values in links of xml type. This is now fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt81665 - The vsim -visualizer option can now be put inside a -f
       option-file.
     * dvt70667 - The -assertdebug option can now be used with the -elab
       flow and with checkpoint/restore.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt79540 - If the -precision option is specified in a user defined
       radix, the option will not be listed in the "radix list" results
       and does not get saved in the wave.do file. This results in the
       user define radix not being restored correctly. This issue has been
       resolved.
     * dvt79542 - Precision values grater than 17 are not currently
       supported in the user defined radix. Attempts to set a precision
       greater than 17 will now return an error message.
     * dvt80314 - Hovering the mouse cursor over an inactive (not in
       process) class method scope can lead to a crash. This issue has
       been resolved.
     * dvt80772 - Help command anomalies have been fixed.
     * dvt82347 - Problem loading Tcllib package stooop in vsim has been
       resolved.
     * dvt82883 - Selected text in the Source window containing certain
       combinations of characters can cause the GUI to crash. This issue
       has been resolved.
     * dvt35002 - Fixed crash when expanding cover group in Objects
       window.
     * dvt80534 - Attempting to open an assert property statement for
       viewing sometimes resulted in a fatal error. This issue has been
       resolved.
     * dvt75988 - Fixed a crash in the UI that sometimes occurs during a
       restart or load of a new design.
     * dvt75360 - Fixed a crash in the UI when selecting or expanding
       certain kinds of objects in the Locals window.
     * dvt18485 - The Search bar in each window is now persistent. This
       means if a Search bar is open within a window when the application
       is closed, the next time the application is launched and the window
       opened, the Search bar will be visible as well.
     * dvt19881 - Using the Find feature in the Preference Dialog box will
       now search the entire contents, no longer requiring the that the
       tree be expanded first.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt79480 - (results) Fixed a bug which results in reversed bit
       connections, when a concat expression is passed to an unpacked port
     * dvt78775 - (results) Under certain circumstances, use of "++" or
       "--" as an index into an array would result in the variable being
       incremented or decremented 2-3 times, instead of just once.
     * dvt79521 - (source, results) If a macro is defined using the
       +define command line option, it will override all `undefs in the
       RTL code, ie, `undef for that macro will be ignored. For backward
       compatibility, the switch -nooverrideundef has been added. If a
       macro is defined using +define command line option, and
       -nooverrideundef is also passed as a compile option, the `undef
       will be honored for that macro.
     * dvt79110 - Fixed a vsim error when an array with more than 32 bit
       length is used.
     * dvt79011 - Fixed a memory corruption when the index of an
       associative array is of type bit.
     * dvt79782 - A select of a hierarchical reference to a net within a
       concatenation connected to an input port resulted in an elaboration
       crash in some cases.
     * dvt79924 - A cell module containing specify timing and system
       function calls resulted in a vopt crash in some unusual cases.
     * dvt79543 - (results) Fixed an issue that would cause randomize() to
       return 0 for some non-contradictory scenarios involving a single
       4-state random variable and a single 'dist' constraint.
     * dvt79679 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would generate
       differing results for a fully optimized simulation vs. a simulation
       where +acc is enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt80089 - An indexed slice of a multi-dimensional packed array
       could result in an erroneous runtime error.
     * dvt73180 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() will produce
       spurious results for random variables involved in a !inside
       (not-inside) constraint if the LHS and RHS contain random
       variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt80393 - Specifying multiple comma-delimited extensions via the
       "vsim -svext" switch would result in an error. This issue has been
       fixed.
     * dvt79748 - Fixed a crash in a scenario when derived class uses
       static class member of super class. Super class is also derived
       from another class which have one non static member with same name
       as of static member. For example class C is derived from class B
       and class B is derived from class A. Class A has some non static
       class member with name as D. Class B has static member with name as
       D. When D is accessed from class C we were getting a crash. This
       has been fixed now.
     * dvt80404 - Improved an error message vsim-3373 which will now print
       the bound values in case of part select of an array. If the array
       is of type dynamic then no bound values of array will be shown.
       Earlier there was no error id at vlog/vopt time, now the error id
       3373 will be used to give the error.
     * dvt80265 - Fixed an error when localparam string array is getting
       initialized.
     * dvt80175 - Fixed a vopt hang when it try to evaluate the value of
       multi dimensional array of type bit.
     * dvt80297 - Fixed a vlog crash when two coverpoints point to same
       variable in parameterized class.
     * dvt80596 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger
       an internal error in slvACTContext. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt81103 - Fixed a small memory leak related to resizing a 'rand'
       or 'randc' dynamic array during randomize().
     * dvt81155 - (results) In some situations a release on a register
       which had a force in effect fails to trigger a continuous
       assignment to that register.
     * dvt81118 - (results) The 'index()' method, when used inside a
       nested array manipulation method, would return the wrong value.
     * dvt80536 - (source) It is not permitted to change the protected
       status of an existing design unit by recompiling it, it must be
       deleted from the library and then recompiled.
     * dvt77481 - (results) Fixed cascaded sequential UDP issue. New
       behavior is more aggressive in finding cascaded SUDP and handling
       them.
     * dvt75730 - A name resolution error could result if an interface
       with an interface port formal and the actual interface instance
       passed to the formal were both instantiated within the same
       generate loop and the interface had additional interfaces
       instantiated within it.
     * dvt81161 - Support of $error/$stop systask usage in optimized cell.
     * dvt80235 - Fixed a vopt error when localparam is assigned as
       unpacked array concatenation.
     * dvt79870 - Fixed a vopt crash when multi-dimensional array of
       interface is used as single dimension.
     * dvt81618 - Fixed a vsim crash when a class function is never
       defined and some other variable is initialized in that class.
     * dvt81318 - Fixed a misleading error vlog-2388 when an array of
       modport is declared in port connection and modport array dimension
       parameter is undefined.
     * dvt80829 - Fixed a vopt crash when array of modport is used as C
       style dimensional array.
     * dvt80968 - Fixed an invalid error when interface array is used and
       vopt is not able to calculate the value of array dimension due to
       floating of parameters or in some other corner scenarios.
     * dvt80196 - Fixed a vlog crash when a parameterized class is
       instantiated with non existing parameters.
     * dvt80475 - Fixed a crash when randomize 'with' function is called
       inside foreach loop.
     * dvt80753 - Downgraded a fatal error to a suppressible error
       (vsim-12064) when multiple version of interface are found in the
       design.
     * dvt81544 - Fixed a bug in vopt which resulted in internal error
       when concat expression is passed as port actual
     * dvt82080 - Fixed a bug in vopt for shift operator which resulted in
       different simulation result with and without +acc.
     * dvt80676 - Fix a bug in vsim which resulted in wrong results for
       streaming concatenation operator.
     * dvt80674 - Checks have been added in vlog to look for stray
       semicolons in declarative regions of task/functions and give
       appropriate errors.
     * dvt80469 - (results) Fixed a bug in handling of an assign statement
       inside a for-loop in verilog. Was already working in SV flow.
     * dvt82348 - (results) Fixed the parsing errors related to empty
       clocking event field in $past and similar calls. LRM allows giving
       empty arguments to these calls.
     * dvt82422 - (results) Fixed an assert failure when there is a
       part-select on an element of a packed struct in the RHS of an
       assign statement.
     * dvt82551 - (results) Fixed an assert failure in vopt where
       out-of-bounds index of a vector is being used in a concatenation.
     * dvt75654 - (results) SDF back-annotation now works with anonymous
       Non-ansi type source and destination ports.
     * dvt82719 - Fixed a bug which resulted in wrong simulation results
       while doing NBA assignment to packed structure.
     * dvt82730 - Fixed a bug which resulted in simulation crash while
       using a "new[]()" to initialize a dynamic array of "rand" type
       using an array of constant width.
     * dvt82580 - Fixed a bug which resulted in simulation crash while
       using ternary operator with nets.
     * [nodvtid] - Vsim crashed with array index references in an inline
       randomization constraint where the index variable was defined
       inside a begin..end block.
     * dvt83328 - (source, results) A new svext switch -svext=arif (allow
       ref in fork) was added to support use of refs in fork-join_any or
       fork-join_none blocks inside tasks. Use of refs in fork-join_any
       and fork-join_none blocks is an error by default.
     * dvt83309 - (results) Under an 'always @(*)', an external reference
       with a non-constant index was not properly being added to the
       sensitivity list. An example woule be 'my_if.data.info[i].id',
       where 'i' is a variable. Now, 'my_if.data.info' will trigger the
       always block.
     * dvt83160 - Fixed a vopt error 2132 when parameter value as
       assignment pattern expression is passed through module parameters.
     * dvt82478 - Fixed a vsim error when Questa is not able to find some
       variables of interface port due to bind.
     * dvt82376 - Made the error 12038 suppressible and added to
       permissive list.
     * dvt81779 - Fixed a vsim error 3043 when same package name appears
       in multiple libraries.
     * dvt83035 - Fixed a vsim crash when a non constant function is
       passed as a delay to assign statement.
     * dvt83603 - Using a parameter array index reference as the offset in
       an indexed slice range could lead to an internal error like:
       # ** Error: test.sv(5): Questa has encountered an unexpected
       internal error: ../../src/vlog/vgencode.c(212).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt79538 - The in some case, if a VHDL block has unconstrained
       output ports The error
       # ** Fatal: (vsim-3420) Array lengths do not match. Left is 0 (0 to
       3). Right is (UNDEFINED) (UNCONSTRAINED ARRAY).
       could occur.
     * dvt79119 - The "change" command would not register changes in the
       WLF file if -vhdlvariablelogging and/or -accessobjdebug was also
       present for the vsim session. Also, WLF file lookup of DOIDs is
       case-insensitive to VHDL access type names.
     * dvt76973 - Variable (including protected type data member variable)
       whose type was array of access to record, could cause a simulator
       crash if the vsim command "vsim" was used to load another (or same)
       design during the same session of the GUI.
     * dvt75261 - (source) If a locally static range of the first form
       (A'RANGE or A'REVERSE_RANGE) was used as the index range in an
       array subtype indication, there was no check that the range bounds
       were compatible with the index subtype of the base array type. This
       has been fixed.
     * dvt79780 - Logging an alias to a signal that is of a resolved
       composite type would crash the simulator.
     * dvt80970 - If a instance of a generic package is made directly
       visible with a via a use statement. Multiple references to the
       package will result in the error
** Error: fails.vhd(4): (vcom-1078) Identifier "pkg" is not directly visible. Po
tentially visible declarations are:
work.pkg in library work (package)
work.pkg at pkg.vhd(1) (declaration)

     * dvt80408 - Having an entity whose name is 200 character long or
       longer could cause the following error during optimization.
** Fatal: (vopt-8) Problem while reading data file
"/export/home/designtree/work/top_opt/vopt4km4ma".
** Error: (vopt-2064) Compiler back-end code generation process terminated with
code 2.

     * dvt81559 - Changed the way VHDL assertion names are created when
       the assertion is inside a subroutine and the subroutine name
       matches with one of the operator symbols. Since this operator
       symbol is prepended in the name, we create an escaped identifier
       for the assertion name.
     * dvt81528 - Occasionally vcom, vopt, or vlog, could crash
       unexpectedly because of the command line arguments. Slightly
       changing the argument number or order can work around the problem.
     * dvt81757 - Fixes crashes at design load time as wells on commands
       that work on bits of a composite port like driver, add log, add
       wave, and other similar commands. The crash required that the
       actual connected to the port be a non-static expression.
     * dvt81883 - An attempt to log an empty array of records, whose
       fields also contain arrays, by explicitly using the log command, or
       by adding the array to the list or wave windows, could cause the
       simulator to crash.
     * dvt82617 - Certain known errors deferred until simulation runtime
       (because whether or not they would be executed is not known) would
       cause a vopt error and fail to create an optimized design.
     * dvt82698 - IF generates with mutually exclusive conditions could
       sometimes both be present when the generate condition contained
       expressions of a certain form, such as multiplication by a generic
       (integer) whose value was 0 in some instances, and non-0 in other
       instances.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt82519 - DPI export task/function calls are not allowed by
       default in the SystemC start_of_simulation() callback. Use vsim
       option '-enabledpisoscb' or modelsim.ini variable 'EnableDpiSosCb'
       to enable DPI export calls from the SystemC start_of_simualtion()
       callback. The side effect of this option will be that any SystemC
       signal writes done in start_of_simulation() callback will not
       reflect the updated value at time 0. A delta cycle using wait
       statement needs to be inserted in the processes to get correct
       value updated for these signals. Also, with mixed language
       simulation, process execution order may change at time 0 with this
       option.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt79482 - Fixed a bug where tool was giving internal error during
       compilation if the design contained a concurrent assertion inside
       an unnamed always block and the assertion had an action block with
       begin...end.
     * dvt80036 - vsim crashed when an assertion used a bit-select of a
       packed struct.
     * dvt80720 - Fixed a bug where nexttime property was not working
       correctly on the right side of implies property.
     * dvt82695 - An assertion having suffix implication with boolean RHS
       gave incorrect result in fully optimized simulation.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt81137 - Allowed mixed designs to use hierarchical reference to
       VHDL port, before it has been fully elaborated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug where Total and Testplan Coverage were not
       being properly reported to the VRM History window.
     * dvt79735 - In VRM, if there are multiple execution methods
       referring to the same named queue, the queue will use the minimum
       value defined for the maxarray/maxclubbing attributes.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM where use of the "-exitcodes" and
       "-nosummary" command-line options in the same vrun command would
       prevent the proper setting of exit codes in the event of Action
       errors.
     * dvt81937 - (results) xml2ucdb fails to replace parameters with
       their values in links of xml type. This is now fixed.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug where ActionCompleted user-definable
       procedure was not being called if an Action failed due to a launch
       error (which includes launch failures detected by the pro-active
       grid checker).
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed a bug that caused the VRM History window to throw
       a TCL error when attempting to read the history database.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.4d
     * dvt79470 - Every PA dynamic check (assertion) will be limited to 15
       messages. Once this limit is reached, that particular dynamic
       message will be suppressed. This limit can be controlled by user
       using CLI " pa msg -suppressafter ".
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There was some noise in -pa_checks=t
       (QPA_PD_OFF_ACT) during power domain transitioning. This issue has
       been fixed now.
     * [nodvtid] - Vopt was throwing wrong error 2164 in case of nested
       modules. This issue has been fixed now.
     * [nodvtid] - There was a crash in xprop when using the option
       "report=suppress". This issue has been fixed now.
     * dvt80237 - Earlier tool used to give error when logic_port was used
       in control port option of power switch. This issue has been fixed
       now, tool now allows usage of logic_port in control port option of
       UPF command create_power_switch.
     * dvt79862 - (results) Fixed an issue in master-slave(also known as
       slave-alive) retention configuration. Now when the retention
       condition is active then the effect of clock, set or reset is
       ignored and the retained value is present at the register output.
     * dvt81090 - Fixed following issues being observed in PA reports (in
       case of a signal with width greater than 256) - Missing signal port
       in report.statc.txt (present in report.upf.txt) - Incorrect count
       in report.static.txt
     * dvt81498 - Changes in static report format to display 'sharing
       count' more intuitively. In stead of * notation we now display
       actual cell count followed by total crossings and Shared crossings.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.4d
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There are multiple VPI changes to the class
       model to align it more closely to the LRM, and to make it more
       useable. Class object names are now aligned to the GUI names. More
       vpi_handle and vpi_iterate queries have been implemented, affecting
       among other things vpiClassTypespec, vpiClassObj, and vpiClassDefn
       objects. Queries for file and line information on class objects
       will return an error, as these objects are not anchored by
       definition to the source code.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.4d
     * dvt83067 - The Class Type column is now visible by default in the
       Covergroup WIndow.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.4d
     * [nodvtid] - $fopen system call now allows adding 't' to other valid
       file type arguments, like 'rt', 'w+t', 'at+' etc.
     * dvt76032 - (source) Reseeding simulation: Added a new VSIM command
       "sv_reseed " which will re-seed every SystemVerilog random number
       generator (thread objects, class objects) based on the specified
       seed (or "random", which will select a random seed). This feature
       can be used after a "vsim -restore" (or at any time) to modify the
       behavior of SystemVerilog random constructs (randomize, randcase,
       randsequence, $urandom, etc) from the point the "sv_reseed" command
       is issued forward. NOTE: There is a small performance impact (both
       speed and memory) on a simulation that has been reseeded.
       Restarting simulation with a new seed: The VSIM command "restart"
       now accepts a "-sv_seed " option, which will restart the simulation
       with the specified seed value (or "random", which will select a
       random seed). Previously, the "set Sv_Seed " command was used
       immediately before a "restart" to instruct Questa to restart
       simulation with a different seed -- this is no longer allowed (the
       "Sv_Seed" variable is now read-only).
     * dvt80984 - Questa reported a type compatibility error for
       parameterized virtual modports with a partial list of overridden
       parameter values.
     * dvt81147 - In some cases, use of an associative array whose key is
       a bit-vector of width > 32 could result in extremely poor
       performance. This has been addressed.
     * dvt81854 - (source) Added control options to alter the behavior of
       certain constraints during randomize() to generate significant
       differences in solution distribution. The options are controlled
       via the "vsim -svrandext" command line option:
       -svrandext=[+|-][,[+|-]]* Enable/disable non-LRM compliant
       SystemVerilog constrained-random language extensions Valid
       extensions are: nonrandstab - disable seeding of "non-random" class
       instances promotedist - promote priority of 'dist' constraint if
       LHS has no solve/before nodist - interpret 'dist' constraint as
       'inside' (ACT only) noorder - ignore solve/before ordering
       constraints (ACT only) skew - skew randomize results (ACT only) The
       new options are "nodist" and "noorder". The other options
       (nonrandstab, promotedist, skew) were previously set via the "vsim
       -svext" command line option, and have been moved to "-svrandext"
       (all SystemVerilog constrained-random related options are now
       grouped under "-svrandext"). Note that "nodist", "noorder", and
       "skew" only apply to the ACT solver engine.
     * dvt82483 - (results) Added a new SystemVerilog Constraint Solver
       extension, -svrandext=[+|-]forkjoinstab. By default this extension
       is disabled. When this extension is enabled, the random stability
       of parent thread is preserved when creating the fork/join
       sub-threads.
     * dvt82697 - (results) Within the context of a constraint, allow a
       random index expression for any packed variable (previously, this
       was only allowed on scalar packed variables). This non-LRM
       compliant extension is enabled by default, and can be disabled with
       "vsim -svrandext=-randpackidx" or with "vsim -pedanticerrors".
     * dvt81353 - Added the vsim command line option "-sv_reseed ". This
       option is only valid when used in combination with -load_elab or
       -restore. If used with -load_elab, the effect of the -sv_reseed
       option is identical to the -sv_seed option. If used with -restore,
       the effect of the -sv_reseed option will be to issue a "sv_reseed"
       command, with the specified argument, immediately after the
       simulation is restored.
     * dvt78261 - (results) Changed the way vsim interprets invalid
       Sv_Seed values (passed in via the vsim "-sv_seed" command line
       option or the "Sv_Seed" modelsim.ini variable). In the past, when
       vsim encountered an invalid Sv_Seed value, an non-suppressible
       error message (vsim-7031) would be displayed and Sv_Seed would be
       set to 0. The new behavior allows the error to be
       downgraded/suppressed, and the value of Sv_Seed will reflect the
       32-bit truncated value of the invalid seed (the interpreted value
       of Sv_Seed will be displayed by the vsim-7031 error message).
     * dvt82275 - (results) The "vsim -sv_reseed" command line option and
       the VSIM "sv_reseed" command are now UVM aware by default (requires
       questa_uvm_pkg 1.2.3) -- when a UVM simulation is re-seeded, the
       random sequences generated by UVM will change as a result. This
       behavior can be disabled with "vsim -uvmcontrol=-reseed".
     * dvt82524 - Added the support for environment variables in curly
       braces within include string literals with svext=evis.
     * dvt82369 - Allowed one argument in builtin function substr with
       svext=substr1. Second argument will be treated as end of string.
     * dvt17592 - Added the support of "%i" format specifier. This will
       print the hierarchical name of the instance of task enabling
       statement or function call.
     * dvt74675 - Added the support for dynamic cast for more than 32 bit
       value.
     * dvt83013 - The protected state of a design unit can now be changed
       by recompiling. In the past this seemed to work with Verilog but
       was intentionally not allowed with VHDL. Now, both languages allow
       this, and the implementation has been made more uniform and
       correct.

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.4d
     * dvt78686 - Coverpoint and cross bin exclusions are now applied
       transitively to all the associated cross bins when -transitive
       option is specified in the coverage exclude command. This options
       must be used with the -cvgpath option in the "coverage exclude"
       command in order to apply the exclusion transitively to the crosses
       containing the excluded coverpoint bins.
     * dvt76485 - (results) In coverage html reports, exclusion comments
       added by the users is added as a tooltip in the hit count cells.
       Also, a plus sign '+' is added in the cell to indicate that this
       cell has an exclusion comment.
     * dvt79285 - (results) In the coverage summary page in html coverage
       report, a new hyperlink named "List of Design Units included in
       report..." is added. When clicked,it will redirect the user to a
       new html page that has a table containing all the design units and
       the coverage percentages for all the available coverage types in
       the design. This table can be sorted by either the total coverage
       or any of the coverage types.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) vcover parallelmerge has following changes:
- Added new options: -32, -64, -log
- Added support for UGE & RTDA grid type
- Changed behavior of -outname option. parallelmerge will now create output file
 with exact given name. It will no longer append '.ucdb' in UCDB mode
- Added support to specify multiple directory paths to -genlistfrom in UCDB mode

     * [nodvtid] - (results) Following enhancements were added to vcover
       parallelmerge:
- Show correct memory with -stats=perf and total number of error/warning counts.
- Show runtime and memory consumed by each parallel merge process
- Show merge errors and warnings by default
- Deprecated -verbose=all mode
- Added -quiet and -verbose mode
- Show parallelmerge command in vcover -help
- Added extra check if merge process gets killed by grid
- Added version number in internally generated RMDB file. If user had copied RMD
B file and modified to support their grid, they will need to update their RMDB f
ile for these new enhancements.

     * dvt28804 - (results) The -checkinputs switch is added in vcover
       merge to skip and report corrupted UCDB input files.
     * [nodvtid] - The covergoups page in the coverage HTML report has
       been changed. The new page has many new features, for example
       sorting and searching. Also its layout has been enhanced to be more
       clear. The new page works on all major browsers. We recommend using
       at least the minimum version of the following browsers: IE 11.0,
       firefox 42.0 and Google Chrome 47.0.

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4d
     * dvt72200 - VRM now provides a built-in TCL utility procedure that
       can generate one or more random tokens based on a master seed
       passed via the "-mseed" command-line option when vrun is launched.
     * [nodvtid] - A global master seed has been added to the VRM GUI. The
       seed may be set using the "-mseed" command-line option when the GUI
       is launched. If a master seed has not been set, one will be
       generated randomly. This master seed is used for all new VRM
       Configurations and for any manual regression runs launched during
       that GUI session. The master seed is saved with the VRM
       Configuration and may be changed with the VRM Configuration Edit
       dialog.
     * [nodvtid] - Added "-historydb" command-line option to VRM to
       specify an alternate history database location. The default history
       database in VRMDATA/logs/db is still updated unless "-nohistory" is
       specified.
     * [nodvtid] - Added GenerateStatusSummary utility procedure which
       returns formatted status summary during a regression run for use in
       emails and reports.
     * [nodvtid] - Added "-junit" command-line option to VRM which causes
       a JUnit results output file to be generated after a regression run.
       The file is generated by a TCL script available under
       vm_src/jenkins/vrm-to-junit.tcl.
     * [nodvtid] - Added SendEmailMessage utility procedure to VRM which
       facilitates the composition and sending of email messages from
       within a running regression.
     * [nodvtid] - The VRM RMDB API now supports a global search for
       parameters and their attributes regardless of the Runnable in which
       they are defined.
     * [nodvtid] - VRM now supports the sending of email, including an
       automated email at the end of a regression run.
     * [nodvtid] - Added "-nogridmsg" to vrun to disable messages when
       missing or failed grid jobs are re-queued by the pro-active grid
       checker.

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.4d
     * [nodvtid] - Added support for custom resolution function of
       supply_nets.
       The use model is as follows :
       (1) User defines an SV resolution function with input type as an
       array of supply_net_type :
       function supply_net_type resolution_func(supply_net_type bus[]);
       (2) User refer to this resolution function in UPF create_supply_net
       command with fully qualified name :
       create_supply_net N1 -resolve sv_package::resolution_function
     * dvt80233 - (source, results) A new VOPT checks-controllability
       option is added that shall enable/disable specified dynamic PA
       check based on the control-signal-expression value. Option:
       [-chksctrl_expr {ctrl-signal-expression}] Sample tcl commands to
       achieve ctrl-signal-expression based controllability: pa_checks
       -checkIds { rpo rop} -chksctrl_expr {/tb/retpwr && /tb/rtc}
     * dvt81110 - Support for UPF 2.1 command connect_logic_net -reconnect
       has been added. This command option "-reconnect" is also enabled in
       UPF 2.0 mode under vopt option -pa_upfextensions=relaxedsyntax
