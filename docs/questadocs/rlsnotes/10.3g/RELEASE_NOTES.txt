   Key Information
     * [nodvtid] - The 10.3g Update Release will be the last release in
       the 10.3 series.

   Release Announcements in 10.3g
     * [nodvtid] -
       In the next major release (10.4), support for Windows XP and
       Windows Vista will be discontinued.
       [10.3e] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.3e.
       However if you are migrating to 10.3e from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.
