[10.3e] Licensing Information
<p>There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.3e.

<p>However if you are migrating to 10.3e from a release like 10.2 and older,
please note the following:

<ul><li>Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The 
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will 
be FLEXnet version 11.11.1.1.
<li>For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
<li>If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
</ul><br>
[10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.<br>
[10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology) library, sources and documentation have been updated to version 2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.<br>
[10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.<br>
[10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.1] Support for GCC versions gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.<br>
