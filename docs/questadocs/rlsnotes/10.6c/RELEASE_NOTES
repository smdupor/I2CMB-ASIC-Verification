   Release Announcements in 10.6c
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5
            x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release,
            gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for
            SystemC have been discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
            limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
          + (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
            deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
            deprecation process:
               o The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a
                 deprecation suppressible error message.
               o In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will
                 not be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with
                 error message.
               o Customer scripts using this switch will have to be
                 changed. This legacy switch forces incremental mode
                 (pre-6.0 behavior) which is sub-optimal, and it is no
                 longer maintained.
               o In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows
                 8.1 will be dropped.
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser
                 PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
                 documentation are fully functional.
                 Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
                 result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
                 current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the
                 PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all
                 web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of
                 this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals
                 is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
                 page-oriented layout.
                 Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate
                 between topics, and click links to examples, videos,
                 reference material, and other related technical content.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6c
       SystemVerilog Compatibility

     * dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly
       in all cases.

   SVA/PSL Compatibility
     * dvt101285 - (source) Fixed a bug where assertion control tasks
       (e.g. $assertoff) were not checking for the type of the argument
       for levels and accepting anything and using it as integer or
       defaulting to value 0. This resulted in incorrect behavior. Now we
       have added the check that the levels argument to these tasks has to
       be an integer expression. Any testcases where level was specified
       using incorrect type will need to be fixed.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a
       test-associated UCDB merge file. This change allows that error to
       be suppressed.
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression
:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.uc
db

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
       ___________________________________________________________________

       General Defects Repaired in 10.6c

     * dvt99930 - Transaction recording can crash the simulator when a
       child transaction ends after it's parent transaction has ended. The
       crash has been fix. (Note: this ordering of $transaction calls is
       not technically correct; child transactions should be ended before
       their parent.)
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6c
     * dvt100029 - The "when" command fails to trigger sometimes with some
       expressions containing nets, vector nets, and multi-dimensional
       nets. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt100318 - The $argv and $argc variables giving access to the
       command line arguments is not available in -batch mode. This issue
       has been resolved.
     * dvt100811 - occasionally in the Assertion Thread Viewer, the text
       in the hierarchical expression tree be drawn in a garbled manner.
       This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt70665 - Questa & ModelSim fail to run if installed in a path
       containing spaces. This issue is now resolved.
     * dvt101418 - The internal "ls" command in the vsim gui behaves
       incorrectly when no arguments are given. This command is only used
       on Windows, when there is no external "ls" command found. This
       issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6c
     * dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly
       in all cases.
     * dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an
       array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an
       internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic
       arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100885 - In some rare cases, randomize() will generate a
       spurious (vsim-7020) error "Illegal attempt to resize random
       dynamic array" when randomizing a dynamic array with
       -solvefaildebug enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100802 - Fixed compiler (vopt/vlog) crashes when DPI function
       calls are used in SystemVerilog constraints.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6c
     * dvt101286 - Fixed a bug where the default message printed using
       command 'assertion fail -print_msg' was always printing error
       message irrespective of the severity of the VHDL assertion. Now,
       the default message has the same severity as the severity specified
       for the assertion.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.6c
     * dvt99466 - While trying to print the vsim-6577 error, for a
       sc_module, sc_port or a sc_prim_channel global or static SystemC
       object that is being destroyed at exit time, vsim might crash in
       some odd scenarios. This issue is now fixed. vsim will report a
       vsim-6522 warning instead and exit gracefully.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.6c
     * dvt101285 - (source) Fixed a bug where assertion control tasks
       (e.g. $assertoff) were not checking for the type of the argument
       for levels and accepting anything and using it as integer or
       defaulting to value 0. This resulted in incorrect behavior. Now we
       have added the check that the levels argument to these tasks has to
       be an integer expression. Any testcases where level was specified
       using incorrect type will need to be fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.6c
     * dvt100091 - An SQL bug and a formatting bug that occurred if the
       "-hierarchical" command-line option was used to generate the VRM
       HTML status report have both been fixed. In addition, the
       non-hierarchical report and the hierarchical report both include
       the Runnable-type icons for consistency.
     * dvt101420 - Fixed an issue with the VRM status report algorithm
       where excessive time was spent maintaining on-the-fly status
       counters which were not even being used, resulting in slow loading
       of the status event log for very large regression runs.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6c
     * dvt100020 - Added support for 'open_value_range' on the RHS of
       'dist' operator -- this allows ranges with '$' as lower or upper
       bound to be specified.
     * dvt100925 - Added support to allow port variables to be used before
       it is declared under -suppress 13299.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Enhancements in 10.6c
     * dvt100099 - Added a new option -print_msg in 'assertion fail'
       command to print default error message all the time when assertion
       fails. This default message is printed irrespective of what is
       specified in the action block. If there is no action block, then
       only this default message is printed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.6c
     * dvt66359 - VRM now supports parallel auto-merge. The feature is
       activated by specifying "-parallelmerge <n>" where <n> is the
       maximum number of concurrent merge operations allowed for a single
       mergefile. In addition, the auto-merge algorithm will defer the
       launching of merges with less than 5 input UCDBs until the minimum
       of 5 UCDBs are queued or until 30 seconds pass with no additional
       UCDBs being queued.
     * [nodvtid] - VRM now supports modifying the mimetype and encoding of
       emails sent from within vrun by modifying certain pre-defined
       parameters in the RMDB.
     * dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a
       test-associated UCDB merge file. This change allows that error to
       be suppressed.
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression
:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.uc
db
