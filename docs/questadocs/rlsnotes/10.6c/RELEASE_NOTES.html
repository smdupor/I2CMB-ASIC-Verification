There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>
 <li>(source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be deprecated in the next major 
release 10.7 following normal deprecation process:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
suppressible error message.
<li>In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not be 
accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error message.
<li>Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed. 
This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior) which 
is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.</li>
 <li>In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows 8.1 will be dropped. </li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

<ul><li>dvt101285 - (source) Fixed a bug where assertion control tasks (e.g. $assertoff) were not checking for the type of the argument for levels and accepting anything and using it as integer or defaulting to value 0. This resulted in incorrect behavior. Now we have added the check that the levels argument to these tasks has to be an integer expression. Any testcases where level was specified using incorrect type will need to be fixed.</li>

<ul><li>dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a test-associated UCDB merge file.
This change allows that error to be suppressed.
<pre>
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.ucdb

<ul><li>dvt99930 - Transaction recording can crash the simulator when a child transaction ends after it's parent transaction has ended. The crash has been fix.  (<i>Note: this ordering of $transaction calls is not technically correct; child transactions should be ended before their parent.</i>)</li>

<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt100029 - The "when" command fails to trigger sometimes with some expressions containing nets, vector nets, and multi-dimensional nets.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt100318 - The $argv and $argc variables giving access to the command line arguments is not available in -batch mode.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt100811 - occasionally in the Assertion Thread Viewer, the text in the hierarchical expression tree be drawn in a garbled manner. This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt70665 - Questa & ModelSim fail to run if installed in a path containing spaces.  This issue is now resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt101418 - The internal "ls" command in the vsim gui behaves incorrectly when no arguments are given.  This command is only used on Windows, when there is no external "ls" command found.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

<ul><li>dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly in all cases.</li>
 <li>dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt100885 - In some rare cases, randomize() will generate a spurious (vsim-7020) error "Illegal attempt to resize random dynamic array" when randomizing a dynamic array with -solvefaildebug enabled. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt100802 - Fixed compiler (vopt/vlog) crashes when DPI function calls are used in SystemVerilog constraints.</li>

<ul><li>dvt101286 - Fixed a bug where the default message printed using command 'assertion fail -print_msg' was always printing error message irrespective of the severity of the VHDL assertion. Now, the default message has the same severity as the severity specified for the assertion.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="systemcdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.6c</b></font>

This issue is now fixed. vsim will report a vsim-6522 warning instead and exit gracefully.</li>

<ul><li>dvt100091 - An SQL bug and a formatting bug that occurred if the "-hierarchical" command-line option was used to generate the VRM HTML status report have both been fixed. In addition, the non-hierarchical report and the hierarchical report both include the Runnable-type icons for consistency.</li>
 <li>dvt101420 - Fixed an issue with the VRM status report algorithm where excessive time was spent maintaining on-the-fly status counters which were not even being used, resulting in slow loading of the status event log for very large regression runs.</li>

<p /><a name="systemverilogenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6c</b></font>

</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="svapslenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>SVA/PSL Enhancements in 10.6c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt100099 - Added a new option -print_msg in 'assertion fail' command to print default error message all the time when assertion fails. This default message is printed irrespective of what is specified in the action block. If there is no action block, then only this default message is printed.</li>

<p /><a name="vmenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>Verification Management Enhancements in 10.6c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt66359 - VRM now supports parallel auto-merge. The feature is activated by specifying "-parallelmerge &lt;n&gt;" where &lt;n&gt; is the maximum number of concurrent merge operations allowed for a single mergefile. In addition, the auto-merge algorithm will defer the launching of merges with less than 5 input UCDBs until the minimum of 5 UCDBs are queued or until 30 seconds pass with no additional UCDBs being queued.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - VRM now supports modifying the mimetype and encoding of emails sent from within vrun by modifying certain pre-defined parameters in the RMDB.</li>
 <li>dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a test-associated UCDB merge file.
This change allows that error to be suppressed.
<pre>
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.ucdb
