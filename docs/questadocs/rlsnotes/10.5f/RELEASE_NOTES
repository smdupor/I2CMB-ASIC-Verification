   Key Information
     * (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in
       10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be
       incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage.
       The required setup change is one of the followings:
       1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype
       declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
       OR
       2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to
       manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines.
       DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
       The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the
       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

     * The 10.5g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.5
       series.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Release Announcements in 10.5f
     * Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + 10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual
            Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the
            executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be
            linked in with "msvcr120.dll". If you have SystemC or
            PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any
            gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be
            re-compiled with 10.5. Windows platform compiler details is as
            follows:
               o "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for
                 download on a request basis.
                 Compiler versions have not been changed compared to
                 previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more
                 details.
               o (source) In the next major release (10.6)
                    # support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change
                      for Windows 8.1
                    # support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and
                      gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
               o We regularly review our OS/Platform support for
                 Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification
                 products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
                 That process normally takes a number of years from
                 decision to action. Customer notifications are typically
                 only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and
                 Install Guide.
                 We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year
                 from now. We began notifications of this change back in
                 January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
                 As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are
                 discontinued, replacement hardware can only support
                 Windows 10. So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP
                 & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity and ability to
                 support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
                 Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to
                 discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only
                 Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10. However
                 we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6
                 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL
                 - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
                 Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser
                 PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
                 documentation are fully functional.
                 Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
                 result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
                 current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the
                 PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all
                 web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of
                 this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals
                 is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
                 page-oriented layout.
                 Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate
                 between topics, and click links to examples, videos,
                 reference material, and other related technical content.

                 Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available
                 options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on
                 SupportNet.
                 Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the
                 U.S. and other countries.
               o In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat
                 Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise
                 Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.5f
       Key Information Compatibility

     * [nodvtid] - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is
       fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may
       be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI
       usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:

# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp.
       For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from
       SV files is required due to this change.
     * dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would
       often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize
       results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have
       been resolved.
     * dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could
       produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing
       composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a
       test-associated UCDB merge file. This change allows that error to
       be suppressed.
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression
:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.uc
db

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In the next major release (10.6)
          + support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows
            8.1
          + support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be
            dropped
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt100975 - Errors occur in -batch mode after queuing for a license
       and then resuming. This issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt100811 - occasionally in the Assertion Thread Viewer, the text
       in the hierarchical expression tree be drawn in a garbled manner.
       This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt70665 - Questa & ModelSim fail to run if installed in a path
       containing spaces. This issue is now resolved.
     * dvt101418 - The internal "ls" command in the vsim gui behaves
       incorrectly when no arguments are given. This command is only used
       on Windows, when there is no external "ls" command found. This
       issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt100885 - In some rare cases, randomize() will generate a
       spurious (vsim-7020) error "Illegal attempt to resize random
       dynamic array" when randomizing a dynamic array with
       -solvefaildebug enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100802 - Fixed compiler (vopt/vlog) crashes when DPI function
       calls are used in SystemVerilog constraints.
     * dvt102251 - In some rare cases, randomize() would produce a
       solution that would violate an equality/inequality constraint
       between two random variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp.
       For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from
       SV files is required due to this change.
     * [nodvtid] - Questa now supports "integral_number"s as a part of an
       "enum_identifier" within an "enum_name_declaration" production.
     * [nodvtid] - In fatal errors involving virtual interfaces Questa may
       have emitted an incorrect file number in the message.
     * dvt102853 - Fixed a simulator internal error when a DPI open array
       with an unsized packed dimension is used. The message is similar
       to: Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error:
       ../../src/vsim/svdpi_runtime.c(2216).
     * dvt17863 - Added support for the use of the 'array.size()' builtin
       function within the context of index expressions for random
       unpacked dynamic arrays/queues in constraints.
     * dvt101989 - In some rare cases, randomize() would generate an
       invalid solution when evaluating constraint expressions of the
       following form: "arr.sum() with (int'(item == const_val))". This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt102459 - Iterative (foreach) constraints may now specify an
       array parameter instead of an array variable on which to iterate.
     * dvt102717 - In some rare cases, randomize() would ignore the 'with'
       clause associated with constraint expressions involving a builtin
       array reduction function (e.g. "foo.bar.sum() with
       (int'(item.baz))". This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would
       often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize
       results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have
       been resolved.
     * dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt101580 - Certain styles of continuous selected signal assignment
       statements with zero delay would not execute properly when
       optimized, either in an optimized design or a design compiled with
       the PE version of the product.
     * dvt102732 - In some specific cases of mixed design where
       'last_value was used.Simulation use to give incorrect result under
       -mlopt option. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could
       produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing
       composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.
     * dvt67231 - Special characters in a comment that was inside an
       encrypted region could cause a parsing error.
     * dvt109476 - The vcom compiler "-just" and "-skip" options now allow
       the specification 'x', which means VHDL 2008 "context"
       declarations.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt104131 - Assertions using bit streaming operator did not
       evaluate correctly.
     * dvt102556 - vsim gave incorrect coverage result for (a ##1 b |-> c)
       type of properties.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt100091 - An SQL bug and a formatting bug that occurred if the
       "-hierarchical" command-line option was used to generate the VRM
       HTML status report have both been fixed. In addition, the
       non-hierarchical report and the hierarchical report both include
       the Runnable-type icons for consistency.
     * dvt101420 - Fixed an issue with the VRM status report algorithm
       where excessive time was spent maintaining on-the-fly status
       counters which were not even being used, resulting in slow loading
       of the status event log for very large regression runs.
     * dvt104125 - Fixed minor error in VRM in procedure which parses the
       Job ID from an RTDA log file.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.5f
     * dvt104923 - Incorrect time advance values in the WLF file caused
       signal transitions to be incorrect in some rare conditions. This
       bug generally manifested itself by signals transitions in the wave
       window showing correctly when zoomed in, but disappearing as one
       zoomed out, then possibly showing again upon zooming out even
       further. This has been fixed, but the bug is in the WLF writer and
       requires WLF files demonstrating this behavior to be regenerated.

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.5f
     * dvt73654 - Added support for random variables in index expressions
       for both packed and unpacked arrays in constraints. The vsim option
       "-svrandext=randindex" can be used to enable/disable this
       extension. This extension is enabled by default. This extension
       replaces the existing extension for random variable support in
       index expressions for packed arrays ("-svrandext=packrandidx" is
       deprecated).
     * dvt100019 - Added SystemVerilog extension to improve support for
       function calls in constraints with complex interactions between the
       function input(s) and function output by allowing functions to be
       called multiple times. Specify vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=funcback" to enable this extension.

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.5f
     * dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a
       test-associated UCDB merge file. This change allows that error to
       be suppressed.
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression
:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.uc
db
