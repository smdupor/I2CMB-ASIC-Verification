<p /><a name="keyinfo"></a><font size="5"><b>Key Information</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will become an error in later releases.
The reason for this change is to remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining a two-step flow.</li>
 <li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li><p>
This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

</p><p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

</p><p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

</p><p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
</p><ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 </li><li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 </li><li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 </li><li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />
For information about Adobe's discontinued support of Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on SupportNet.<br /><br />
Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
</p><p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
</p><p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP &amp; Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 in the future.
</p><p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 &amp; 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<ul><li>QSIM-54037 - (results)  In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also improved.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving &quot;unique&quot; constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55627 - (results)  In some rare cases involving equality constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no solutions when &quot;-solvefaildebug=2&quot; is specified. The diagnostic output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.<br /><br /><br /></li>

<p /><a name="verilogdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7e</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-29891 -  In some cases, invoking randomize() via a dotted path containing a function call (e.g. &quot; r.get_field().randomize() with {...}&quot;) would cause an error or crash during compilation. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-53856 -  Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real' type on the RHS (e.g. &quot;myvar inside { array_of_real }&quot;) would trigger an internal error &quot;==? operator invalid for REAL&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54037 - (results)  In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54298 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would cause simulation to crash when evaluating a scenario with the BDD solve engine. This issue has been fixed.</li>

 <li>QSIM-56318 -  In some rare cases, an internal error would occur during randomize() indicating an error in slvACTNodeMap. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56429 - In
some rare cases, certain kinds of ternary constraint expressions would trigger an internal error during randomize(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55187 - Certain lists of expressions, as in a concatenation, could cause a compiler crash if there was a missing element; this is a syntax error now correctly handled.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56462 - An index variable in a streaming concat expression like b1 = {&gt;&gt; {b2 with [0 +: len]}} would sometimes generate an error at vsim time because the variable &quot;len&quot; was expected to be a constant expression.  The typical error was:&lt;br&gt;<br /> ** Error: (vsim-3044) Usage of 'mod.len' inconsistent with 'register' object.<br /> <br /><br /></li>
