   Key Information
     * QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of
       deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
       recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
       (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
       process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will
       become an error in later releases. The reason for this change is to
       remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation
       libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the
       post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with
       pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining
       a two-step flow.
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license
       servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       Article MG596568 on SupportNet.
       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-54037 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2().
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to
       the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving
       constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior
       related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been
       corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also
       improved.
     * QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving "unique"
       constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions)
       for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios
       involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no
       solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55627 - (results) In some rare cases involving equality
       constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the
       constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no
       solutions when "-solvefaildebug=2" is specified. The diagnostic
       output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a
       fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-55137 - (results) In certain cases, vopt was crashing during
       optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7e
     * QSIM-29891 - In some cases, invoking randomize() via a dotted path
       containing a function call (e.g. " r.get_field().randomize() with
       {...}") would cause an error or crash during compilation. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-53856 - Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real'
       type on the RHS (e.g. "myvar inside { array_of_real }") would
       trigger an internal error "==? operator invalid for REAL". This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54037 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2().
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54298 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause simulation
       to crash when evaluating a scenario with the BDD solve engine. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to
       the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving
       constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior
       related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been
       corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also
       improved.
     * QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving "unique"
       constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions)
       for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios
       involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no
       solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55627 - (results) In some rare cases involving equality
       constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-56318 - In some rare cases, an internal error would occur
       during randomize() indicating an error in slvACTNodeMap. This issue
       has been fixed.
     * QSIM-56429 - In some rare cases, certain kinds of ternary
       constraint expressions would trigger an internal error during
       randomize(). This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55187 - Certain lists of expressions, as in a concatenation,
       could cause a compiler crash if there was a missing element; this
       is a syntax error now correctly handled.
     * QSIM-56462 - An index variable in a streaming concat expression
       like b1 = {>> {b2 with [0 +: len]}} would sometimes generate an
       error at vsim time because the variable "len" was expected to be a
       constant expression. The typical error was:<br>
       ** Error: (vsim-3044) Usage of 'mod.len' inconsistent with
       'register' object.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7e
     * QSIM-55460 - A VHDL 2008 IF-GENERATE with ELSIF-GENERATE
       alternative block(s) could cause a simulator crash if vopt could
       determine that a condition was FALSE.
     * QSIM-55137 - (results) In certain cases, vopt was crashing during
       optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55531 - If a component or an entity contains a generic whose
       type is dependent on another generic of the component or entity.
       Code generation in vcom or vopt could fail.
     * QSIM-56373 - A VHDL design unit whose source text is in 2 or more
       files is not supported. An error will be issued if such a situation
       is detected.
     * [nodvtid] - FLI function mti_FindDriver() would crash in some
       situations involving composite signals.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.7e
     * QSIM-55481 - Fix scparse to handle C++11 scoped enums.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.7e
     * VM-10952 - Fixed issue with internal testlist parser where multiple
       test lines with the same name and a repeat count of one would
       result in a "duplicate entry" error when the RMDB was expanded.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bogus error message emitted when VRM (vrun)
       doesn't detect the proper license.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7e
     * QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the
       constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no
       solutions when "-solvefaildebug=2" is specified. The diagnostic
       output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a
       fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.
     * QSIM-54662 - Constraint expressions involving multiplication of
       'real' type operands are now supported during randomize() when the
       "realrand" SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default).
       Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a
       SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.
