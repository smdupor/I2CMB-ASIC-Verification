<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:
<br>
1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
<br>
OR
<br>
2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines. DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
<br>
The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the above will incur the following warning at elab time
<br>
<pre>
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.
</pre>
and the fatal error at runtime:
<pre>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'
</pre>
</li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - <p>
Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - <p>
10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be linked in with "msvcr120.dll".
If you have SystemC or PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be re-compiled with 10.5. 
Windows platform compiler details is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product. 
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for download on a request basis.
<p>
Compiler versions have not been changed compared to previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more details.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) In the next major release (10.6)<br>
   <ul> 
   <li>support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows 8.1
   <li>support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
</ul></li>

<ul><li>dvt87194 - (results) simstats commands will now print memory data in scaled format, instead of earlier behavior of printing in Kb format. This change will make output consistent with the default output of -stats option. User can still get older behavior by using 'kb' option with these commands, for example 'simstats kb', 'simstats verbose kb'.

simstatslist command will still print unscaled memory data, as earlier.

<ul><li>dvt89803 - A crash in the qwavedb writer while logging initial values of class data members is fixed.  A memory leak in Visualizer caused by the qwavedb file generated with this fix to the writer is also fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt87143 - Using a lock file, prevent attempt to overwrite a qwave.db file that is being generated by a QuestaSim process.  Previously, this would corrupt the qwave.db file and cause Visualizer to crash on loading the file.</li>

 <li>dvt88550 - In some rare cases, running vsim with the -solvefaildebug switch enabled would cause an internal error during randomize(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt89119 - (results) In GUI mode, the VSIM "restart" command would ignore a specified "-sv_seed <seed>" option if "-f" is not also specified. This issue has been fixed.</li>

 <li>dvt70869 - Fixed the compilation issue and added proper support for 'super.randomize(null)'</li>

 <li>dvt35748 - When +cover was specified to vcom, implicit operators were included in the set of subprograms that were added to the Structure window in the GUI, along with user-defined subprograms.  Implicit operators are no longer part of this set.</li>
 <li>dvt89183 - Concatenation expressions involving a qualified expression whose operand was also a concatenation expression could sometimes cause a vcom internal error.</li>

<p /><a name="assertiondefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.5c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt89114 - Fixed a bug where filter option in some of the assertion commands was not working for immediate assertions. This prevented users to select only XPROP assertions. An XPROP bug has also been fixed to make this work for the XPROP assertions.</li>
 <li>dvt89440 - Assertion evaluation was wrong when there were multiple instances of sequence.matched. </li>
