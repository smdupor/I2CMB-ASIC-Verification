   Key Information
     * [nodvtid] - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is
       fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may
       be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI
       usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:
       1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype
       declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
       OR
       2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to
       manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines.
       DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
       The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the
       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

   Release Announcements in 10.5c
     * [nodvtid] - In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat
       Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
       10 will be dropped.
     * [nodvtid] -
       Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + [nodvtid] -
            10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual
            Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the
            executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be
            linked in with "msvcr120.dll". If you have SystemC or
            PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any
            gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be
            re-compiled with 10.5. Windows platform compiler details is as
            follows:
               o "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for
                 download on a request basis.
                 Compiler versions have not been changed compared to
                 previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more
                 details.
               o [nodvtid] - (source) In the next major release (10.6)
                    # support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change
                      for Windows 8.1
                    # support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and
                      gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.5c
       Key Information Compatibility

     * [nodvtid] - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is
       fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may
       be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI
       usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:

       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt89119 - (results) In GUI mode, the VSIM "restart" command would
       ignore a specified "-sv_seed " option if "-f" is not also
       specified. This issue has been fixed.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fix failure to annotate limit to timing check
       where condition comes from LHS of simple "assign".

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where
       both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give
       an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of
       association element". This has been fixed.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt87194 - (results) simstats commands will now print memory data
       in scaled format, instead of earlier behavior of printing in Kb
       format. This change will make output consistent with the default
       output of -stats option. User can still get older behavior by using
       'kb' option with these commands, for example 'simstats kb',
       'simstats verbose kb'. simstatslist command will still print
       unscaled memory data, as earlier.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In the next major release (10.6)
          + support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows
            8.1
          + support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be
            dropped
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.5c
     * dvt89803 - A crash in the qwavedb writer while logging initial
       values of class data members is fixed. A memory leak in Visualizer
       caused by the qwavedb file generated with this fix to the writer is
       also fixed.
     * dvt87143 - Using a lock file, prevent attempt to overwrite a
       qwave.db file that is being generated by a QuestaSim process.
       Previously, this would corrupt the qwave.db file and cause
       Visualizer to crash on loading the file.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.5c
     * dvt88260 - The sensitivity extracted for @* was incorrect in some
       cases.
     * dvt88550 - In some rare cases, running vsim with the
       -solvefaildebug switch enabled would cause an internal error during
       randomize(). This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt89119 - (results) In GUI mode, the VSIM "restart" command would
       ignore a specified "-sv_seed " option if "-f" is not also
       specified. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt89597 - Fixed an internal error during randomize().
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fix failure to annotate limit to timing check
       where condition comes from LHS of simple "assign".
     * dvt85848 - Added extension -svrandext=deepcheck to allow
       class::randomize(null) to consider constraints from contained
       'rand' class handles.
     * dvt70869 - Fixed the compilation issue and added proper support for
       'super.randomize(null)'
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.5c
     * dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where
       both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give
       an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of
       association element". This has been fixed.
     * dvt35748 - When +cover was specified to vcom, implicit operators
       were included in the set of subprograms that were added to the
       Structure window in the GUI, along with user-defined subprograms.
       Implicit operators are no longer part of this set.
     * dvt89183 - Concatenation expressions involving a qualified
       expression whose operand was also a concatenation expression could
       sometimes cause a vcom internal error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.5c
     * dvt89114 - Fixed a bug where filter option in some of the assertion
       commands was not working for immediate assertions. This prevented
       users to select only XPROP assertions. An XPROP bug has also been
       fixed to make this work for the XPROP assertions.
     * dvt89440 - Assertion evaluation was wrong when there were multiple
       instances of sequence.matched.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.5c
     * dvt87194 - (results) simstats commands will now print memory data
       in scaled format, instead of earlier behavior of printing in Kb
       format. This change will make output consistent with the default
       output of -stats option. User can still get older behavior by using
       'kb' option with these commands, for example 'simstats kb',
       'simstats verbose kb'. simstatslist command will still print
       unscaled memory data, as earlier.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.5c
     * dvt89920 - Added operation to export selected signals to VCD file
       from Wave window.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.5c
     * dvt76166 - Questa has supported the SystemVerilog interface
       self-reference using an interace::self() syntax. This enhancement
       adds support for an interface self-reference using the name of the
       interface which may be more portable.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Enhancements in 10.5c
     * dvt88602 - Added support for associative arrays in SystemVerilog
       Assertions.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.5c
     * [nodvtid] - Added support for UPF command 'use_interface_cell'.
