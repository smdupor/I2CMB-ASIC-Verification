   Release Announcements in 10.4b
     * [nodvtid] -
       [10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been
       discontinued.
       [10.4] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.
       However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs
       that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.4b.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4b

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) There has been a change in the VPI
       interface to vpiAssertion class objects. The SystemVerilog 2012 LRM
       indicates that vpiAssertion objects may be iterated for from
       vpiInstance class objects only, not from all vpiScopes, however
       assertion objects may in fact be under other scope class parents.
       We have previously added these sub-scope descendant assertions to
       the instance assertion. This change makes the assertion iteration
       valid on all scope objects to bring it into line with similar
       vpiVariable iterations. A consequence is that sub-scope iterations
       are necessary to find all the assertions in an instance.
     * dvt76428 - (results) Under certain conditions, a wait on a method
       call, like 'wait(q.size())', would never trigger.
     * dvt77400 - (results) In some cases a bogus vsim-3391 'Requested
       memory exceeds physical memory' message can be generated when
       relatively little virtual memory is actually being used but very
       large objects are being allocated and freed while processing
       dynamic arrays and similar objects. In 10.3d and 10.3e it will
       generate a Failure messages that stops the simulation. It can be
       resumed with a second run command, or the 'suppress 3391' vsim
       switch can eliminate it. In 10.4 it is will not stop the
       simulation. It can be suppressed the same way. If the operating
       system shows that the process is indeed larger then physical
       memory, then the message is not bogus, and suggests that poor
       performance will result due to heavy paging. After the fix the
       transcript file will no longer contain the bogus message.
     * dvt75975 - (results) Questa was unable to support a
       class-specialization prefix as a static cast type. This is now
       supported. For example :
class parent #(int x = 10);
endclass
class child #(int y=10) extends parent #(y);
endclass
module top;
  parent p;
  child c1=new, c2;

  initial begin
    p = c1;
    c2 = child #(.y(10))'(p);
  end
     * dvt62347 - (results) vlog-2292 error incorrectly printed "OVM"
       related message regardless of whether OVM or UVM loading failed.
       This has been corrected to reflect the right context.
     * dvt76928 - (results) This was a bug in the context of a function
       inside a class. If the function has a default value for an argument
       and the argument has exactly the same name as the default value ,
       then this was leading to incorrect results. This has been
       corrected. A sample example of the bug scenario :
package p1;
        int num = 1;
        class C;
        function int get_int(int num = num );
            return 1;
        endfunction : get_int
        endclass
endpackage : p1

module top;
    import p1::*;
                C c = new;
                initial begin
                c.get_int();
                end
endmodule : top

     * dvt77231 - (results) Fixed a bug in usage of tagged unions inside a
       case statement inside a task.
     * dvt77144 - (results) Questa was incorrectly allowing some wrong
       syntax involving the keywords 'this' or 'super' along with
       class-specialisations to parse in vlog. This was resulting in
       errors later in vsim. Have fixed this behaviour. Here is a sample
       scenario.
package pkg;
   class c1#();
       virtual task run();
       endtask
   endclass
   class c2 extends c1;
   endclass;

   class c3 ;
      virtual task run();
      endtask
      task t();
        this.c1#()::run();// this gives a syntax error now
      endtask
   endclass
endpackage

     * dvt76429 - (results) Add support for const cast expression in
       constraints. The constraint expression "const'(expr)" will evaluate
       "expr" as a constant value. Random variables referenced by "expr"
       will be evaluated as if non-random. The value of a random variable
       referenced by "expr" will be sampled prior to randomize() (for
       class::randomize, the value will be sampled after pre_randomize()).
     * dvt76126 - (results) vlog error 13028 has been made suppressible.
       LRM requires the keyword 'inside' to be followed by a left brace.
       This error was already allowed to be ignored by -permissive

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt77769 - (results) A type conversion from a floating point type
       to an integer type will now produce an Error message if the
       floating point value is outside the range of a signed 32-bit
       integer. Also, a type TIME expression involving a floating point
       expression will produce an Error message if the result is outside
       the range of a 64-bit signed integer; in this case, the lower bound
       is -9223372036854775807, which is the smallest position number
       allowed for type TIME. Finally, a type conversion will check that
       the result belongs to the subtype denoted by the type mark of the
       target type.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt68442 - (results) SV covergroup coverage was different in merged
       file depending on the merge order of input UCDB files due to
       excluded auto cross bins.
     * dvt74268 - (results) Covered auto cross bin was not getting into
       the merged UCDB if that bin is uncovered in the master UCDB.
     * dvt69525 - (results) Some toggle nodes of a VHDL record were
       missing in viewcov mode
     * dvt71906 - (results) The vcover merge now reports error 6854 by
       default for conflicting test names
     * dvt75218 - (results) Functional coverage items are now reported for
       each instance and DU in byinstance and bydu text reports

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fixed an issue of wrong simulation result due
       to retention being applied on a signal in bitwise manner.

   General Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A crash has been fixed when +nowarn option is
       used with no arguments in vsim. For eg. "vsim +nowarn top_module"
       will result in error now.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Error ID 2411 and 2412 have been assigned to
       permissive error messages 'Enum. range value must be a non-negative
       integer' and 'Enum. range must be a positive integer' respectively.
       These messages can be suppressed with '-suppress' now. Verror help
       has been added to these IDs too.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt72260 - (results) The Test Analysis menu in Structure window was
       generating paths using "::" as a separator which are not valid in
       viewcov mode.
     * dvt76258 - (results) The ranktest summary has been augmented to
       include the number of contributing and non-contributing tests.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs
       that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.4b.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * dvt76763 - Fixed a bug in pduspec flow which resulted in incomplete
       visibility requirements during the usage of partial hierarchical
       paths instead of complete path.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A crash has been fixed when +nowarn option is
       used with no arguments in vsim. For eg. "vsim +nowarn top_module"
       will result in error now.
     * [nodvtid] - Binaries of the licensing part and all of its
       dependencies were in 32-bits even for 64-bits products. This has
       been fixed so they are now 64-bits binaries for 64-bits products.
       This applies to Linux & Windows.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * dvt63651 - A drag-area zoom-in operation in the wave window would
       sometimes zoom to the wrong location. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt77471 - Wave window cursor frequency display shows incorrectly
       scaled values for certain time resolution values. This problem has
       been corrected.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * dvt76118 - A typedef for a queue in a base class wasn't being
       properly handled in the child class.
     * dvt75845 - Variable part select on a class member dynamic array
       would sometimes give incorrect results. This has been fixed.
     * dvt76428 - (results) Under certain conditions, a wait on a method
       call, like 'wait(q.size())', would never trigger.
     * dvt75528 - Allowed a virtual function to be overridden by a pure
       virtual function. Below example will work after the fix. Example:-
       class a; virtual task body(); $display("hi, i am in a"); endtask
       endclass virtual class b extends a; pure virtual task body();
       endclass
     * dvt76387 - The prototypes of DPI functions inside nested interface
       were not generated in dpiheader generation.
     * dvt76021 - Fixed the vsim results in novopt mode when out of bound
       array element is passed in port connection.
     * dvt76289 - Use of a nonblocking event trigger, ie, "-->event_var",
       resulted in a memory leak.
     * dvt76314 - Fixed a bug in $enable_signal_spy/$disable_signal_spy
       which resulted in error(vsim-3861) in cases where absolute path for
       the signals is not given with these system calls. For example
       following usage which used to give error will now work correctly:
module top_tb;
...
$init_signal_spy("top_tb/sig1", "top_tb/sig2", 1, 0);
$enable_signal_spy("top_tb/sig1", "top_tb/sig2", 1);
...
endmodule

     * dvt76400 - Fixed a bug which resulted in false error(vsim-3045)
       while calling a SV task/function with default values of arguments
       from verilog. For example following usage which used to give error
       will now work correctly:
test1.sv :
//this file compiled as SV source code
...
task setup_gpio(int a = 1);
...
endtask
...

test2.v :
//This file compiled a verilog source code
...
tb.setup_gpio();
...

     * dvt76285 - Added compile time error which makes sure the name does
       not already exist in the scope with the same direction. Following
       usage is now compile time error :
 clocking clk_blk @(CLK);
        default input #0;
        input port1;
        input port1;
  endclocking : clk_blk;

     * [nodvtid] - A net having multiple drivers with varying strengths
       resolved to an incorrect value in some cases.
     * dvt76661 - The compiler incorrectly issued a "data size overflow"
       error for large unpacked arrays and structures that overflowed a
       32-bit integer size even when compiled for 64-bit.
     * dvt76961 - Fixed an issue when multiple part-select expressions are
       used in foreach loop.
     * dvt76247 - Fixed a vsim error when default type parameter (T)
       passed to a class (A) is of another class type (B) whose parameter
       is a virtual interface (x). For example class A#(type T =
       B#(virtual interface x));
     * dvt77400 - (results) In some cases a bogus vsim-3391 'Requested
       memory exceeds physical memory' message can be generated when
       relatively little virtual memory is actually being used but very
       large objects are being allocated and freed while processing
       dynamic arrays and similar objects. In 10.3d and 10.3e it will
       generate a Failure messages that stops the simulation. It can be
       resumed with a second run command, or the 'suppress 3391' vsim
       switch can eliminate it. In 10.4 it is will not stop the
       simulation. It can be suppressed the same way. If the operating
       system shows that the process is indeed larger then physical
       memory, then the message is not bogus, and suggests that poor
       performance will result due to heavy paging. After the fix the
       transcript file will no longer contain the bogus message.
     * dvt77310 - Type-casting $cast function with void will not result in
       error even when casting operation fails. For example following will
       not result in error when $cast fails :
void'($cast(d_obj, c_obj));
     * dvt77198 - Fixed a bug in case within statement which resulted in
       wrong simulation results while having more than 32 cases.
     * dvt70538 - Typedef defined in super class would sometimes not
       visible to derived class. This has been fixed.
     * dvt77431 - Fixed a vsim error when return type of an external
       function in parameterized class is the self referential class.
       Example:- function my_class#(my_class::PARAM1) my_class::get ();
     * dvt75438 - Fixed a vlog crash when new() is called on a forward
       typedef class.
     * dvt75975 - (results) Questa was unable to support a
       class-specialization prefix as a static cast type. This is now
       supported. For example :
class parent #(int x = 10);
endclass
class child #(int y=10) extends parent #(y);
endclass
module top;
  parent p;
  child c1=new, c2;

  initial begin
    p = c1;
    c2 = child #(.y(10))'(p);
  end
     * dvt62347 - (results) vlog-2292 error incorrectly printed "OVM"
       related message regardless of whether OVM or UVM loading failed.
       This has been corrected to reflect the right context.
     * dvt76928 - (results) This was a bug in the context of a function
       inside a class. If the function has a default value for an argument
       and the argument has exactly the same name as the default value ,
       then this was leading to incorrect results. This has been
       corrected. A sample example of the bug scenario :

            return 1;
        endfunction : get_int
        endclass
endpackage : p1

module top;
    import p1::*;
                C c = new;
                initial begin
                c.get_int();
                end
endmodule : top

     * dvt77231 - (results) Fixed a bug in usage of tagged unions inside a
       case statement inside a task.
     * dvt77144 - (results) Questa was incorrectly allowing some wrong
       syntax involving the keywords 'this' or 'super' along with

       errors later in vsim. Have fixed this behaviour. Here is a sample
       scenario.
package pkg;
   class c1#();
       virtual task run();
       endtask
   endclass
   class c2 extends c1;
   endclass;

   class c3 ;
      virtual task run();
      endtask
      task t();
        this.c1#()::run();// this gives a syntax error now
      endtask
   endclass
endpackage

     * dvt77608 - cosim libvsim.so exported symbol changed to avoid
       collision.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * dvt70676 - Some uses of A'RANGE (and A'REVERSE_RANGE) where a value
       (not a range) is required were not being caught as errors by the
       compiler.
     * [nodvtid] - Writing a value to a file of a type whose type mark is
       a scalar subtype that has a range constraint would not check that
       the value belonged to the subtype. This has been fixed.
     * dvt67887 - Associating a signal alias with a port, where the
       subtype indication of the alias declaration is a partially
       constrained record, would result in a design that would fail during
       elaboration.
     * dvt75934 - unexpected internal error: ../../src/vsim/vinst.c(7889)
       issue resolved.
     * dvt69385 - Declaring and using aliases of external signals in a
       block would crash.
     * dvt73631 - If a subprogram instantiates a package, and then calls a
       subprogram of the package, variables of the called subprogram may
       not be visible or accessible in the graphical interface or through
       the examine command. In addition, if the design is optimized with
       vopt using the +cover switch to enable code coverage, during
       elaboration of the design, the simulator's console terminal may
       report errors of the form:
../../src/vsim/rtu.c(xxxx). Please contact Questa support at http://supportnet.m
entor.com/

     * dvt77077 - A crash could occur when using an output port as the
       actual to a subprogram formal that is a signal Rising_edge is an
       example of such a subprogram. Because of optimization, this doesn't
       no occur for all cases and maybe affected by the use of switches
       like -no1164 and -O1.
     * dvt76995 - A variable of a protected type that contains a data
       member that is of class FILE could not be displayed, examined, or
       logged properly. Since FILEs themselves cannot be logged, such a
       protected type variable will have the FILE data member be shown as
       "Not Loggable", and the WLF file (for post-sim viewing) will not
       show the variable as having this FILE at all.
     * dvt77275 - A Fatal error during elaboration could occur within an
       optimized vhdl process if signal valued attributes are used within
       that process. The name reported for the optimized processed will
       start #MERGED#.
     * [nodvtid] - Bad machine code would be generated in the case of an
       access type to an generic type and the generic type's actual is a
       record type. This could result in crashes or incorrect simulation
     * dvt77420 - Memory corruption could occur if a generic package is
       instantiated within the scope of a subprogram. Instances of a
       generic package outside of subprogram is unaffected by this issue.
       The memory corruption has been fixed.
     * dvt77769 - (results) A type conversion from a floating point type
       to an integer type will now produce an Error message if the
       floating point value is outside the range of a signed 32-bit
       integer. Also, a type TIME expression involving a floating point
       expression will produce an Error message if the result is outside
       the range of a 64-bit signed integer; in this case, the lower bound
       is -9223372036854775807, which is the smallest position number
       allowed for type TIME. Finally, a type conversion will check that
       the result belongs to the subtype denoted by the type mark of the
       target type.

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * dvt77498 - Pass count for deferred assertions were incorrect in
       full vopt flow.
     * dvt76997 - Property 'eventually' and 'until' gave incorrect results
       when expressions used local vars.

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * [nodvtid] - In VRM, if a given Action is supposed to produce a
       UCDB, and does, but the UCDB is unreadable, the Action will be
       considered to have failed and the UCDB TESTSTATUS will be reported
       as "Unknown Error" in the VRM log.
     * dvt72260 - (results) The Test Analysis menu in Structure window was
       generating paths using "::" as a separator which are not valid in
       viewcov mode.
     * [nodvtid] - Under certain circumstances, the instance tree
       generated from an RMDB file (VRM) was not being expanded correctly.
     * dvt77329 - On the Runnables tab of the Configuration Edit dialog of
       the VRM GUI, attempting to un-check any of the selected Runnables
       after the "Show Latest Status" checkbox was checked would cause a
       TCL error.

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.4b
     * dvt75575 - Extended Power Aware static checks to analyze PST
       information for both power/ground pairs simultaneously when PST
       Composition is enabled. This is available with -pa_pstcompflags=pg
       option.
     * dvt76982 - With -pa_enable=verbosereporting option, the tool now
       prints the full hierarchical path of the power domain in
       report.pa.txt, report.upf.txt & report.mspa.txt.
     * dvt77535 - Fixed an issue where the design when run in PA mode the
       tool gives vopt error 12003 and 7033. Whereas in normal mode, these
       vopt errors did not occur. These errors are not present in PA mode
       now.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fixed an issue of wrong simulation result due
       to retention being applied on a signal in bitwise manner.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed an issue of high disk usage due to excessive
       bind_checker commands applied on same scope.
     * [nodvtid] - In a specific case vopt PA was crashing due to
       CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY simstate. This issue has been fixed now.
     * [nodvtid] - In a specific case vopt was crashing due to UPF
       connect_supply_net command on hdl ports.This issue has been fixed
       now.

   General Enhancements in 10.4b
     * dvt25231 - The following license related items are added to
       'simstats' command report.
       [simstats verbose]
       New 'elab' report item is added for checked-out license features
       names.
       Example:
       # elab: license features used qhsimvl
       [simstats license]
       New 'License Statistics' section is added for checkout time and
       checked-out
       license features names. Example:
       # License Statistics
       # license: checkout time 0.05 s
       # license: features used qhsimvl
     * [nodvtid] - Vsim memory reported by questa will now be the peak
       memory attained by the vsim process rather than the memory at the
       completion of the vsim process.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Error ID 2411 and 2412 have been assigned to
       permissive error messages 'Enum. range value must be a non-negative
       integer' and 'Enum. range must be a positive integer' respectively.
       These messages can be suppressed with '-suppress' now. Verror help
       has been added to these IDs too.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.4b
     * dvt76429 - (results) Add support for const cast expression in
       constraints. The constraint expression "const'(expr)" will evaluate
       "expr" as a constant value. Random variables referenced by "expr"
       will be evaluated as if non-random. The value of a random variable
       referenced by "expr" will be sampled prior to randomize() (for
       class::randomize, the value will be sampled after pre_randomize()).
     * dvt76165 - Allowed integral to string type assignments without
       going through a explicit cast under "-permissive" or "-suppress
       7070" option. Following usage will work with "-permissive" or
       "-suppress 7070" :
function void register_c(string name);
endfunction

reg r;
register_c(r);

     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) There has been a change in the VPI
       interface to vpiAssertion class objects. The SystemVerilog 2012 LRM
       indicates that vpiAssertion objects may be iterated for from
       vpiInstance class objects only, not from all vpiScopes, however
       assertion objects may in fact be under other scope class parents.
       We have previously added these sub-scope descendant assertions to
       the instance assertion. This change makes the assertion iteration
       valid on all scope objects to bring it into line with similar
       vpiVariable iterations. A consequence is that sub-scope iterations
       are necessary to find all the assertions in an instance.
     * dvt76126 - (results) vlog error 13028 has been made suppressible.
       LRM requires the keyword 'inside' to be followed by a left brace.
       This error was already allowed to be ignored by -permissive

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.4b
     * [nodvtid] - vcover parallelmerge command now supports auto-rerun
       feature for failed parallel processes (due to either job submission
       or merge failure). Job submission failures are rerun by default.
       Merge failure rerun can be enabled with -mergererun option. Number
       of retries for both rerun types can be controlled with -maxrerun
       option.
-maxrerun < val >            : Specify maximum number of times job queue, timeou
ts
                               or merge failure processes are rerun automaticall
y. (Default: 10)
                               Specifying 0 will disable reruns for all failures
 types
-mergererun                  : Allow merge failure processes to rerun automatica
lly

     * [nodvtid] - vcover parallelmerge command allows user to override
       temporary directory path.
     -tempdir "< dir_path >"        : Specify temporary directory for intermedia
te output
                                      (Default: "$cwd/TEMP_MERGE_DIR")


     * dvt75218 - (results) Functional coverage items are now reported for
       each instance and DU in byinstance and bydu text reports
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4b
     * dvt75933 - Various improvements to the pro-active grid status check
       function.
          + Added CacheStatus and GetCachedStatus user-definable
            procedures for managing cached grid status data
          + Job status is only used if the grid status command is
            successful
          + Additional messages emitted when an Action fails because of
            the pro-active check
     * [nodvtid] - Added "role" attribute to Action script elements in
       RMDB. A role allows Action scripts of one type to behave line
       Action scripts of a different type with respect to named queue
       selection, timeout computation, and automatic local re-run. Added
       "-showtimeouts" command-line option to display computed timeouts.
     * dvt75977 - Merge Actions (mergeScript) in VRM are now re-run as-is
       upon failure. Added "mergeRerun" utility procedure and
       "-nomergererun" command-line option to control re-run behavior.
     * dvt76258 - (results) The ranktest summary has been augmented to
       include the number of contributing and non-contributing tests.
     * dvt66540 - There is a new optional command line option to ranktest
       which may be used to set the maximum number of parallel process: [
       -j < number_of_parallel_processes > ]
     * [nodvtid] - Added a new "-noucdb" command-line option to vrun (VRM)
       to avoid unnecessary UCDB file reading.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.4b
     * dvt76437 - Support for UPF command "query_cell_instances" has been
       added.
     * dvt75000 - UPF package function supply_on/supply_off can now be
       used from UVM package/functions and classes. The supply search
       protocol is: 1. Search for supply net/port in the scope of the
       calling function 2. Search in "-pa_top" scope 3. Search in module
       provided with -pa_powertop option
     * dvt77237 - Questa PASim now accepts a list of UPF file in vopt.
       List of UPF files can be specified with vopt option -pa_upflist .
       This option is mutually exclusive with -pa_upf option.
     * dvt76985 - Added the support for -supply and -domain options in
       add_power_state UPF command
