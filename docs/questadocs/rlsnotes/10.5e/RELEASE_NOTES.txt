   Key Information
     * (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in
       10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be
       incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage.
       The required setup change is one of the followings:
       1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype
       declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
       OR
       2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to
       manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines.
       DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
       The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the
       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

     * The 10.5g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.5
       series.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Release Announcements in 10.5e
     * In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise
       Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be
       dropped.
     * Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + 10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual
            Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the
            executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be
            linked in with "msvcr120.dll". If you have SystemC or
            PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any
            gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be
            re-compiled with 10.5. Windows platform compiler details is as
            follows:
               o "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for
                 download on a request basis.
                 Compiler versions have not been changed compared to
                 previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more
                 details.
               o (source) In the next major release (10.6)
                    # support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change
                      for Windows 8.1
                    # support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and
                      gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser
                 PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
                 documentation are fully functional.
                 Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
                 result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
                 current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the
                 PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all
                 web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of
                 this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals
                 is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
                 page-oriented layout.
                 Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate
                 between topics, and click links to examples, videos,
                 reference material, and other related technical content.

                 Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available
                 options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on
                 SupportNet.
                 Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the
                 U.S. and other countries.
               o In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows
                 8.1 will be dropped.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.5e
       Key Information Compatibility

     * [nodvtid] - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is
       fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may
       be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI

C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could
       drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1
       primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value)
       drive a single output port.
     * dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or
       multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify
       block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.
     * dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to
       X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM.
     * dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly
       in all cases.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt98805 - (source) In case, case generate, selected signal
       assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error
       was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For
       example "CASE s'RANGE" would not result in an syntax error. It was
       either treated as length of the range or an internal error was
       reported from vcom or vopt.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch
       was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s)
       '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit
       specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain
       a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line
       character.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt91786 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to
       cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose
       resulting output is still single bit.
       For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] &&
       in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as
       single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded
       as a single term for coverage.
       To enable the feature, -coverFecSingleTerm switch (in addition to
       other coverage switches) is needed in vopt.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In the next major release (10.6)
          + support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows
            8.1
          + support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be
            dropped
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.5e
     * dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch
       was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s)
       '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit
       specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain
       a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line
       character.
     * dvt99930 - Transaction recording can crash the simulator when a
       child transaction ends after it's parent transaction has ended. The
       crash has been fix. (Note: this ordering of $transaction calls is
       not technically correct; child transactions should be ended before
       their parent.)
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.5e
     * dvt97421 - The "compare annotate" command returns an error as
       undefined, which is incorrect. The "compare" command help suggests
       "annotation", which is incorrect. This problem has been solved,
       "compare annotate" works, and the help text has been corrected.
     * dvt97551 - Control+mouse wheel zooming in the Wave window would
       incorrectly also scroll the view vertically. This problem has been
       fixed, as well as other minor inconsistencies with mouse wheel
       scrolling.
     * dvt83149 - The Wave window analog display will correctly use user
       defined fixed radix types when computing and displaying the analog
       real or integer values.
     * dvt98987 - With the Process window open and in Hierarchy mode, the
       context ends up at the wrong process. Consequently, any inspection
       of call stack for values is wrong or fails to work at all. This can
       happen when one of the active process's parent threads has
       terminated. When this is the case, the Process window will now
       switch to "Active" mode in order to correctly display the current
       selected active process.
     * dvt100029 - The "when" command fails to trigger sometimes with some
       expressions containing nets, vector nets, and multi-dimensional
       nets. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt100318 - The $argv and $argc variables giving access to the
       command line arguments is not available in -batch mode. This issue
       has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.5e
     * dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could
       drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1
       primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value)
       drive a single output port.
     * dvt96162 - Simulation mismatch with different full optimization
       when using delayed clocking Blocks.
     * dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or
       multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify
       block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.
     * dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to
       X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM.
     * dvt99227 - Fixed a vopt crash when concatenation expression is used
       in the let statement. The concatenation expression contain the
       external declaration and let is in class task.
     * dvt98818 - Fixed a vsim crash when a real number is displayed as
       integer.
     * dvt98214 - If a signal 'say reg r' is updated with #0.xxx delay in
       a initial block which rounded to #0 delay and there is also an
       always block on r. Then the always block will also be executed with
       change in r.
     * dvt97683 - Fixed an invalid vsim-8304 when passing struct element
       to function ref argument through class virtual interface.
     * dvt97692 - Fixed a vopt crash when replication constant is
       calculated through some constant function with structure as
       argument.
     * dvt96735 - Fixed an invalid circular dependency error when value of
       a parameter in interface is calculated through constant function
       with argument as structure member.
     * dvt99463 - Fixed memory leak when forces on optimized cell ports
       are present.
     * dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly
       in all cases.
     * dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an
       array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an
       internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic
       arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100497 - Fixed an internal error / crash during randomize() that
       would occur for some scenarios involving 'dist' constraints on
       random variables > 256 bits wide.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.5e
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.
     * dvt97593 - Direct instantiation of an entity with a package
       instantiation in one of the generic map associations could cause
       incorrect code to be generated by the compiler, possibly leading to
       a loading failure message from the simulator.
     * dvt98805 - (source) In case, case generate, selected signal
       assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error
       was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For
       example "CASE s'RANGE" would not result in an syntax error. It was
       either treated as length of the range or an internal error was
       reported from vcom or vopt.
     * dvt99166 - Writing a STRING to the FILE STD.TEXTIO.OUTPUT (which is
       stdout) using the function STD.TEXTIO.WRITE[TEXT,STRING] could
       result in a crash if the string contained two terminating LF (0x0a)
       characters.
     * dvt99443 - Record aggregate with OTHERS could result in a vcom or
       vopt crash if the expression was not of the same subtype as the
       record element(s) being associated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.5e
     * dvt99466 - While trying to print the vsim-6577 error, for a
       sc_module, sc_port or a sc_prim_channel global or static SystemC
       object that is being destroyed at exit time, vsim might crash in
       some odd scenarios. This issue is now fixed. vsim will report a
       vsim-6522 warning instead and exit gracefully.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.5e
     * dvt97896 - Some assertions clocked by a bit-select of a variable
       woke up even when that bit of the variable is not changing.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.5e
     * dvt99074 - A preference setting has been added to disable export of
       the Primary selection from the Structure and Objects windows. The
       preference variable is PrefMain(exportTreeSelection). An "on"
       (default) value makes the selected item available as the Primary
       selection and can be pasted into other windows and applications. An
       "off" will disable the export. Explicit copy operations will
       continue to be supported in both modes.

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.5e
     * [nodvtid] - Vlog can optionally ignore commas, ",", and right
       parens, ")", when found within a `" `" string that forms a list of
       macro argument actuals within another macro expansion. The
       -svext=+mtdl switch enables this behavior.
     * dvt98467 - Added a SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension to consider all fields of an unpacked struct as 'rand',
       regardless of whether an explicit 'rand' attribute is specified for
       the field or not. This extension is disabled by default. Enable
       this extension using the vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=+randstruct".
     * dvt100020 - Added support for 'open_value_range' on the RHS of
       'dist' operator -- this allows ranges with '$' as lower or upper
       bound to be specified.

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.5e
     * dvt91786 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to
       cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose
       resulting output is still single bit.
       For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] &&
       in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as
       single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded
       as a single term for coverage.
       To enable the feature, -coverFecSingleTerm switch (in addition to
       other coverage switches) is needed in vopt.

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.5e
     * dvt66359 - VRM now supports parallel auto-merge. The feature is
       activated by specifying "-parallelmerge <n>" where <n> is the
       maximum number of concurrent merge operations allowed for a single
       mergefile. In addition, the auto-merge algorithm will defer the
       launching of merges with less than 5 input UCDBs until the minimum
       of 5 UCDBs are queued or until 30 seconds pass with no additional
       UCDBs being queued.
     * [nodvtid] - VRM now supports modifying the mimetype and encoding of
       emails sent from within vrun by modifying certain pre-defined
       parameters in the RMDB.

   WLF and VCD logging Enhancements in 10.5e
     * dvt94883 - In post-sim mode (vsim -view), The 'Cover Directives'
       window is now populated.
