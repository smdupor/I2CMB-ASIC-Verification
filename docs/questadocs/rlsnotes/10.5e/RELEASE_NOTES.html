<ul><li>(source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:
<br>
1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
<br>
OR
<br>
2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines. DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
<br>
The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the above will incur the following warning at elab time
<br>
<pre>
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.
</pre>
and the fatal error at runtime:
<pre>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'
</pre>
</li>
 <li>The 10.5g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.5 series.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="rlsannouncement"></a><font size="4"><b>Release Announcements in 10.5e</b></font>
<ul><li>In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.</li>
 <li><p>
Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li><p>
10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be linked in with "msvcr120.dll".
If you have SystemC or PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be re-compiled with 10.5. 
Windows platform compiler details is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product. 
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for download on a request basis.
<p>
Compiler versions have not been changed compared to previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more details.
</li>
 <li>(source) In the next major release (10.6)<br>
   <ul> 
   <li>support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows 8.1
   <li>support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
</ul></li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

 <li>dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM. </li>
 <li>dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly in all cases.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt98805 - (source) In  case, case generate, selected signal assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For example "CASE s'RANGE"  would not result in an syntax error. It was either treated as length of the range or an internal error was reported from vcom or vopt.</li>
 <li>dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s) '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line character.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt91786 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose resulting output is still single bit.
<br>
For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] && in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded as a single term for coverage.
<br>
To enable the feature, -coverFecSingleTerm switch (in addition to other coverage switches) is needed in vopt.

 <li>dvt99930 - Transaction recording can crash the simulator when a child transaction ends after it's parent transaction has ended. The crash has been fix.  (<i>Note: this ordering of $transaction calls is not technically correct; child transactions should be ended before their parent.</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.5e</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt97421 - The "compare annotate" command returns an error as undefined, which is incorrect.  The "compare" command help suggests "annotation", which is incorrect.  This problem has been solved, "compare annotate" works, and the help text has been corrected.</li>
 <li>dvt97551 - Control+mouse wheel zooming in the Wave window would incorrectly also scroll the view vertically.  This problem has been fixed, as well as other minor inconsistencies with mouse wheel scrolling.</li>
 <li>dvt83149 - The Wave window analog display will correctly use user defined fixed radix types when computing and displaying the analog real or integer values.</li>
 <li>dvt98987 - With the Process window open and in Hierarchy mode, the context ends up at the wrong process.  Consequently, any inspection of call stack for values is wrong or fails to work at all.  This can happen when one of the active process's parent threads has terminated.  When this is the case, the Process window will now switch to "Active" mode in order to correctly display the current selected active process.</li>
 <li>dvt100029 - The "when" command fails to trigger sometimes with some expressions containing nets, vector nets, and multi-dimensional nets.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt100318 - The $argv and $argc variables giving access to the command line arguments is not available in -batch mode.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

 <li>dvt96162 - Simulation mismatch with different full optimization when using delayed clocking Blocks. </li>
 <li>dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.</li>
 <li>dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM. </li>
 <li>dvt99227 - Fixed a vopt crash when concatenation expression is used in the let statement. The concatenation expression contain the external declaration and let is in class task. </li>
 <li>dvt98818 - Fixed a vsim crash when a real number is displayed as integer.</li>
 <li>dvt98214 - If a signal 'say reg r' is updated with #0.xxx delay in a initial block which rounded to #0 delay and there is also an always block on r. Then the always block will also be executed with change in r.</li>
 <li>dvt97683 - Fixed an invalid vsim-8304 when passing struct element to function ref argument through class virtual interface.</li>
 <li>dvt97692 - Fixed a vopt crash when replication constant is calculated through some constant function with structure as argument.</li>
 <li>dvt96735 - Fixed an invalid circular dependency error when value of a parameter in interface is calculated through constant function with argument as structure member.</li>
 <li>dvt99463 - Fixed memory leak when forces on optimized cell ports are present.</li>
 <li>dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly in all cases.</li>
 <li>dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt100497 - Fixed an internal error / crash during randomize() that would occur for some scenarios involving 'dist' constraints on random variables > 256 bits wide.</li>
