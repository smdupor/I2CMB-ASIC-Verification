<ul><li>dvt95794 - Added modelsim.ini variable "AllowCheckpointCpp", a companion variable for existing vsim -allowcheckpointcpp switch

<pre>
   -allowcheckpointcpp 1|0 Turn on/off the support for checkpointing foreign C++ libraries.
                           Must be used in the vsim session where a checkpoint is created.

; Enable the support for checkpointing foreign C++ libraries.
; The valid arguments are: 1 and 0. 
;     1 : turn on the support
;     0 : turn off the support (default)
; This option is not supported on the Windows platforms.

 <li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li><p>
This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.0 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 <li>MSL v2017_1 <li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.0 <li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
</li>

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<ul><li>dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.</li>
 <li>dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1 primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value) drive a single output port.</li>
 <li>dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.</li>
 <li>dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM. </li>
 <li>dvt96725 - (results) A protected object cannot have its value reported using VPI.
</li>
 <li>dvt99392 - (results) Unnamed generate block in a protected region would not have its name changed to <protected> when it was involved in the output from a %m format specifier.  This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt96138 - (results) Real values passed to a wire port used to report junk values, if read as it is. This is now fixed and the real value is now rounded of to nearest integer and then passed on to integer type port. Earlier, Questa used to support real values passed to port to be interpreted through $bitstoreal. This behavior is not supported anymore. For such a case to work, real values should first be converted to equivalent bits using $realtobits and then bits received at port should be read back using $bitstoreal.</li>
 <li>dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly in all cases.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added a new suppressible error for the 'if' statement cases, in which condition expression is non singular type. Suppressible error will come with 'if' and 'else if' non singular condition expression cases.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added a new suppressible error 7080 for the non singular condition expressions in 'if' and 'else if' statements.
For eg. 
    reg ar[5];
    if (ar)   // non singular condition
    ...
This will give suppressible error now.</li>
 <li>dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp. For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from SV files is required due to this change.
</li>
 <li>dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have been resolved.
</li>
 <li>dvt96810 - (results) The new default vlog/vopt behavior to ignore PATHPULSE$ specparam's can be overriden by using the +pathpulse command line option.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) always@(*) with delay or event usage inside the process will now trigger on bit/part/field-select of the variable instead of full variable. To disable this new behavior or go back to old release behavior, user can use 'vopt -svext=-basd' option.</li>
 <li>dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver profile report by removing details that are not relevant to performance, along with the following improvements:
  - display CPU time in seconds (instead of ticks)
  - display CPU time stats for top 10 individual calls for each callsite
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt98805 - (source) In  case, case generate, selected signal assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For example "CASE s'RANGE"  would not result in an syntax error. It was either treated as length of the range or an internal error was reported from vcom or vopt.</li>
 <li>dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument. This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.</li>
 <li>dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256, of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.</li>
 <li>dvt97035 - (results) In some cases, assignment statement within a for loop would have their line number changed to something else.  This would result in incorrect coverage information being generated. Stepping through the loop would case the source display to jump to an incorrect line.</li>
 <li>dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.</li>
 <li>dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output. This has been fixed. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemC  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error. SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be recompiled with the 10.6a release.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SVA/PSL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt101285 - (source) Fixed a bug where assertion control tasks (e.g. $assertoff) were not checking for the type of the argument for levels and accepting anything and using it as integer or defaulting to value 0. This resulted in incorrect behavior. Now we have added the check that the levels argument to these tasks has to be an integer expression. Any testcases where level was specified using incorrect type will need to be fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now, the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs. </li>
 <li>dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read, correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the status of a single option, but accepted multiple options. Starting with 10.7 an error is issued if more than one option is specified.</li>
 <li>dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s) '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line character.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt90645 - (results) Wildcard bins are now supported in covergroup crosses.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) The UDP Coverage is not a recommended coverage collection metric and has been deprecated in 10.7. The following suppressible error message appears when usage of UDP coverage is detected in 10.7,
<br>
"** Error (suppressible): (vlog-192) UDP expression coverage has been deprecated and will be removed in future releases."
<br>
The user can still use UDP coverage feature by suppressing the error, however it will be removed completely in future releases.
</li>
 <li>dvt79889 - (results) Few toggle related vsim options have been deprecated in 10.7 and will be removed in future releases. These options are listed below:<br>1. -togglemaxfixedsizearray <br>2. -togglefixedsizearray <br>3. -togglevlogints <br>4. -notogglevlogints <br>5. -notogglefixedsizearray <br>

<br>Following warning messages will appear if these options are used:<br>

<ul><li>dvt101747 - (source) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >' command, the '-showattr' argument has been deprecated in favor of the '-attribute' argument. Additionally, the '-attributeAll' argument is now supported.</li>
 <li>dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not supported.
Such an action would break the integrity of the bin counts in the database.
An error message is issued when an attempt is made to delete a test while using
'coverage edit -delete -test < test name >'.</li>
 <li>dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a test-associated UCDB merge file.
This change allows that error to be suppressed.
<pre>
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.ucdb
</pre></li>
 <li>dvt101748 - (results) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >' command, the '-nononcontrib' and '-nosummary' arguments are now supported.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add" command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design elements which are inferred as registers e.g. regs/logic/bits/functions etc. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>User Interface  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt97716 - (results) Systemverilog Named Events now display a value in the GUI when examined or shown in any window where named items display values.  The value for a Named Event will be the last simulation time the event was triggered.  It will be displayed in the form "->@45 ns".  If the event was never triggered, then the value "&lt;no-events&gt;" will be displayed.</li>

<p /><a name="generaldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>General Defects Repaired in 10.7</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt94966 - The capstat command and options have been redesigned. The capstat option for vsim is as follows:<br><pre>
   -capstats[=&ltargs&gt[,]]   Enables capstats report
                           &ltargs&gt are du, decl, line, eor and filename=&ltfilename&gt.
                           Arguments are specified separated by comma.
                           The argument du has suboptions: summary, details and duname=&ltduname&gt
                           These suboptions can be specified separated by '+'
</pre>

The capstat comamnd is as follows:<br> <pre>
capstats [-du [+summary | +details] [+duname=&ltduname&gt]] [-decl] [-line] [-filename &ltfilename&gt]</pre>
<br>
If no option is specified, capstats prints summary report under top categories. 
<br>A design unit based breakup of memory can be seen by specifying -du option. For extra details, summary or details options can be used. Specific design units can be specified using duname suboption. If design units are specified, then design unit based report is generated only for the specified design units. 
<br>
-decl option prints declaration based report for dynamic objects.
<br>
-line option prints line based report for dynamic objects.</li>
 <li>dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the status of a single option, but accepted multiple options. Starting with 10.7 an error is issued if more than one option is specified.</li>
 <li>dvt96193 - The profile summary command now displays an 'Other' field that displays the number of samples not counted in the listed categories. </li>
 <li>dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s) '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line character.</li>

 <li>dvt5888 - Questa now supports reading vector based port declarations in evcd file. The option to read this file is -vcdstim which is an existing option. There is no additional option needed to use this functionality. Vector based evcd file can be generated from Questa using +dumpports+collapse option.</li>
 <li>dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver profile report by removing details that are not relevant to performance, along with the following improvements:
  - display CPU time in seconds (instead of ticks)
  - display CPU time stats for top 10 individual calls for each callsite
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Significantly improved performance and memory use related to randomize() scenarios evaluated by the BDD solver engine.</li>
 <li>dvt100019 - Added SystemVerilog extension to improve support for function calls in constraints with complex interactions between the function input(s) and function output by allowing functions to be called multiple times.

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - The "-debug" option on the vrun command may now optionally take the form "-debug=<flags>" where "flags" is a comma-separated list of debug flags. The only debug flag supported currently is "usertcl" which will cause a message to be emitted before and after any usertcl procedure is executed. The legacy "-debug" option behaves as before.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - The TCL status report from VRM now includes total and testplan coverage data (per mergefile). All status reports now report coverage from VRM status event log instead of re-reading the merged UCDB file.</li>
 <li>dvt66359 - VRM now supports parallel auto-merge. The feature is activated by specifying "-parallelmerge &lt;n&gt;" where &lt;n&gt; is the maximum number of concurrent merge operations allowed for a single mergefile. In addition, the auto-merge algorithm will defer the launching of merges with less than 5 input UCDBs until the minimum of 5 UCDBs are queued or until 30 seconds pass with no additional UCDBs being queued.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - VRM now supports modifying the mimetype and encoding of emails sent from within vrun by modifying certain pre-defined parameters in the RMDB.</li>
 <li>dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a test-associated UCDB merge file.
This change allows that error to be suppressed.
<pre>
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.ucdb
</pre></li>
 <li>dvt101747 - (source) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >' command, the '-showattr' argument has been deprecated in favor of the '-attribute' argument. Additionally, the '-attributeAll' argument is now supported.</li>
 <li>dvt101748 - (results) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >' command, the '-nononcontrib' and '-nosummary' arguments are now supported.

<p /><a name="paenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>Power Aware Enhancements in 10.7</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt97428 - Following enhancements have been made in 'power on reset assertion':

Non-Retention Register Reset : 

Current Implementation:

(vopt -pa_checks=npu): Checks that non-retention registers are reset when the power domain containing them is powered up.

Sample error message:
** Error: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 12 ns, Asynchronous (set/reset) control for the following flop(s) of power domain 'PD1' is not asserted at power up:
# /tb/top_inst/out1.
# File: test.upf, Line: 4, Power Domain:PD1

Updated Implementation:

 

User can specify following 2 design attributes to add timing control in 'power on reset' assertion:

set_design_attributes -attribute qpa_attr_inactive_reset_duration Tmax
set_design_attributes -attribute qpa_attr_active_reset_duration Twidth

If these attributes are defined, then 'Power on reset' assertions shall be defined as following:

QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF:       (vopt -pa_checks=npu)  : 
1)      Checks that Asynchronous Reset must be asserted within Tmax time units after power-up.
2)      Checks that Asynchronous Reset must not be deasserted before Twidth time units after getting asserted.

Sample Error Messages:
# ** Error: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 16 ns,  Asynchronous(set/reset) control for the following flop(s) in scope '/tb/top_inst' of power domain 'PD0' is not asserted within 4 time-units after power up:
# out2,
# out[0],
# out[1],
# File: ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line:           4, Power Domain:PD0

# ** Note: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 19 ns,  Asynchronous(set/reset) control for the following flop(s) in scope '/tb/top_inst' of power domain 'PD0' is deasserted within 3 time-units after getting asserted:
# out1,
# out5.
# File: ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line:           4, Power Domain:PD0

If these attributes are not defined, we fall back to original behavior.
</li>
 <li>dvt97427 - All Low power messages can be redirected to a specified file (in stead of default transcript) by means of vsim option -pa_logfile <filename></li>
 <li>dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add" command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design elements which are inferred as registers e.g. regs/logic/bits/functions etc. </li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Added the support for UPF 3.0 HDL package functions. Following are the details of the functions supported. 

HDL access functions:
- upf_get_handle_by_name
- upf_query_object_properties
- upf_iter_get_next

Immediate read access functions:
- upf_get_value_int
- upf_get_value_str
- get_supply_value
- get_supply_voltage
- get_supply_on_state
- get_supply_state

Immediate write access functions:
- supply_on
- supply_off
- supply_partial_on
- set_supply_state

Continuous access function:
- upf_create_object_mirror - Only read access is supported.

Utility functions:
- upf_query_object_type
- upf_query_object_pathname

For the function upf_query_object_properties, not all the objects and properties are supported. Please refer to the user doc to get the details.</li>
