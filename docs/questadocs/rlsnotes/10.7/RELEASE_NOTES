   Key Information
     * dvt95794 - Added modelsim.ini variable "AllowCheckpointCpp", a
       companion variable for existing vsim -allowcheckpointcpp switch
   -allowcheckpointcpp 1|0 Turn on/off the support for checkpointing foreign C++
 libraries.
                           Must be used in the vsim session where a checkpoint i
s created.

; Enable the support for checkpointing foreign C++ libraries.
; The valid arguments are: 1 and 0.
;     1 : turn on the support
;     0 : turn off the support (default)
; This option is not supported on the Windows platforms.
;
; AllowCheckpointCpp = 1


     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license
       servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.0
       and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.0
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       Article MG596568 on SupportNet.
       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.7

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one
       element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are
       different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.
     * dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could
       drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1
       primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value)
       drive a single output port.
     * dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or
       multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify
       block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.
     * dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to
       X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM.
     * dvt96725 - (results) A protected object cannot have its value
       reported using VPI.
     * dvt99392 - (results) Unnamed generate block in a protected region
       would not have its name changed to when it was involved in the
       output from a %m format specifier. This has been fixed.
     * dvt96138 - (results) Real values passed to a wire port used to
       report junk values, if read as it is. This is now fixed and the
       real value is now rounded of to nearest integer and then passed on
       to integer type port. Earlier, Questa used to support real values
       passed to port to be interpreted through $bitstoreal. This behavior
       is not supported anymore. For such a case to work, real values
       should first be converted to equivalent bits using $realtobits and
       then bits received at port should be read back using $bitstoreal.
     * dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly
       in all cases.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added a new suppressible error for the 'if'
       statement cases, in which condition expression is non singular
       type. Suppressible error will come with 'if' and 'else if' non
       singular condition expression cases.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added a new suppressible error 7080 for the
       non singular condition expressions in 'if' and 'else if'
       statements. For eg. reg ar[5]; if (ar) // non singular condition
       ... This will give suppressible error now.
     * dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp.
       For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from
       SV files is required due to this change.
     * dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would
       often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize
       results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have
       been resolved.
     * dvt96810 - (results) The new default vlog/vopt behavior to ignore
       PATHPULSE$ specparam's can be overriden by using the +pathpulse
       command line option.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) always@(*) with delay or event usage inside
       the process will now trigger on bit/part/field-select of the
       variable instead of full variable. To disable this new behavior or
       go back to old release behavior, user can use 'vopt -svext=-basd'
       option.
     * dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver
       profile report by removing details that are not relevant to
       performance, along with the following improvements: - display CPU
       time in seconds (instead of ticks) - display CPU time stats for top
       10 individual calls for each callsite

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt98805 - (source) In case, case generate, selected signal
       assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error
       was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For
       example "CASE s'RANGE" would not result in an syntax error. It was
       either treated as length of the range or an internal error was
       reported from vcom or vopt.
     * dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function
       call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual
       argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument.
       This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the
       formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code
       to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument
       values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.
     * dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256,
       of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.
     * dvt97035 - (results) In some cases, assignment statement within a
       for loop would have their line number changed to something else.
       This would result in incorrect coverage information being
       generated. Stepping through the loop would case the source display
       to jump to an incorrect line.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.
     * dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could
       produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing
       composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.
     * dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being
       used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output.
       This has been fixed.

   SystemC Compatibility
     * dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow
       checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as
       the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active
       constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design
       has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported
       constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage
       that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.
       SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be
       recompiled with the 10.6a release.

   SVA/PSL Compatibility
     * dvt101285 - (source) Fixed a bug where assertion control tasks
       (e.g. $assertoff) were not checking for the type of the argument
       for levels and accepting anything and using it as integer or
       defaulting to value 0. This resulted in incorrect behavior. Now we
       have added the check that the levels argument to these tasks has to
       be an integer expression. Any testcases where level was specified
       using incorrect type will need to be fixed.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was
       being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained
       a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in
       it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog
       but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now,
       the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI
       task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs
       failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs.
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the
       status of a single option, but accepted multiple options. Starting
       with 10.7 an error is issued if more than one option is specified.
     * dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch
       was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s)
       '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit
       specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain
       a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line
       character.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt90645 - (results) Wildcard bins are now supported in covergroup
       crosses.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The UDP Coverage is not a recommended
       coverage collection metric and has been deprecated in 10.7. The
       following suppressible error message appears when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected in 10.7,
       "** Error (suppressible): (vlog-192) UDP expression coverage has
       been deprecated and will be removed in future releases."
       The user can still use UDP coverage feature by suppressing the
       error, however it will be removed completely in future releases.
     * dvt79889 - (results) Few toggle related vsim options have been
       deprecated in 10.7 and will be removed in future releases. These
       options are listed below:
       1. -togglemaxfixedsizearray
       2. -togglefixedsizearray
       3. -togglevlogints
       4. -notogglevlogints
       5. -notogglefixedsizearray
       Following warning messages will appear if these options are used:
       ** Warning: (vsim-12116) "-togglefixedsizearray" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12116) "-togglemaxfixedsizearray" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12116) "-notogglefixedsizearray" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12117) "-togglevlogints" option is now deprecated
       and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12117) "-notogglevlogints" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt101747 - (source) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >'
       command, the '-showattr' argument has been deprecated in favor of
       the '-attribute' argument. Additionally, the '-attributeAll'
       argument is now supported.
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a
       test-associated UCDB merge file. This change allows that error to
       be suppressed.
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression
:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.uc
db

     * dvt101748 - (results) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >'
       command, the '-nononcontrib' and '-nosummary' arguments are now
       supported.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add"
       command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design
       elements which are inferred as registers e.g.
       regs/logic/bits/functions etc.

   User Interface Compatibility
     * dvt97716 - (results) Systemverilog Named Events now display a value
       in the GUI when examined or shown in any window where named items
       display values. The value for a Named Event will be the last
       simulation time the event was triggered. It will be displayed in
       the form "->@45 ns". If the event was never triggered, then the
       value "<no-events>" will be displayed.

   General Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt94966 - The capstat command and options have been redesigned.
       The capstat option for vsim is as follows:
   -capstats[=&ltargs>[,]]   Enables capstats report
                           &ltargs> are du, decl, line, eor and filename=&ltfile
name>.
                           Arguments are specified separated by comma.
                           The argument du has suboptions: summary, details and
duname=&ltduname>
                           These suboptions can be specified separated by '+'

       The capstat comamnd is as follows:
capstats [-du [+summary | +details] [+duname=&ltduname>]] [-decl] [-line] [-file
name &ltfilename>]
       If no option is specified, capstats prints summary report under top
       categories.
       A design unit based breakup of memory can be seen by specifying -du
       option. For extra details, summary or details options can be used.
       Specific design units can be specified using duname suboption. If
       design units are specified, then design unit based report is
       generated only for the specified design units.
       -decl option prints declaration based report for dynamic objects.
       -line option prints line based report for dynamic objects.
     * dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the
       status of a single option, but accepted multiple options. Starting
       with 10.7 an error is issued if more than one option is specified.
     * dvt96193 - The profile summary command now displays an 'Other'
       field that displays the number of samples not counted in the listed
       categories.
     * dvt97602 - (results) If the file specified with vsim's "-f" switch
       was a DOS format file containing line-continuation character(s)
       '\', then vsim emitted incorrect "(vsim-3369) Top-level design unit
       specified more than once" errors. The error message didn't contain
       a module name, but just an empty '' containing a new-line
       character.
     * dvt80904 - The vlog, vopt and vsim message IDs 2675, 2684 and 3017
       are replaced by 2685. Also 2291 is replaced by 2388 and 2718 with
       2817. All message control options like -suppress, -error, -warning
       etc will have to be updated if they use any of the retired IDs.
     * dvt81998 - Added functionality for verror. Now, verror can take
       comma separated list of IDs and prints verror message for all of
       them. User can now give input such as "verror id1,id2"
     * dvt85852 - Added support for -autoprofile usage with -elab,
       -elab_cont, and -load_elab.
     * dvt98187 - Added support for -autoprofile on a cold restore
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt70665 - Questa & ModelSim fail to run if installed in a path
       containing spaces. This issue is now resolved.
     * dvt102099 - The noforce command incorrectly returns an error status
       when used in vsim -batch mode. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt104114 - An incorrect warning "VSIM-3581" is no longer issues
       when using -appendlog along with -restore or -load_elab options.
     * dvt36562 - Using the mouse scroll wheel in the Memory View window
       now scrolls the window contents correctly.

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt93575 - Fixed a vopt crash when doing concatenation of queues.
       Example :- queue = '{ queue, queue_ };
     * dvt93510 - Fixed a vlog crash when virtual interface specialization
       is used with empty parameter. Example:- virtual intf #(.param())
     * dvt92312 - Fixed a vsim invalid error when nested unpacked array
       concatenation is passed to a port and internal concatenation is
       regular vector concatenation.
     * [nodvtid] - vlog's -E output might incorrectly emit
       "`pragmaprotect" rather than "`pragma" whitespace "protect".
     * dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could
       drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1
       primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value)
       drive a single output port.
     * dvt97601 - (results) vsim crashed, when multiple specify paths or
       multiple timing checks were present on the same line (in specify
       block), and "-sdfreport" was specified on vsim command line.
     * dvt97533 - (results) Interconnect delay was not correct for all to
       X transitions as per 1364-2001 LRM.
     * dvt96725 - (results) A protected object cannot have its value
       reported using VPI.
     * dvt99392 - (results) Unnamed generate block in a protected region
       would not have its name changed to when it was involved in the
       output from a %m format specifier. This has been fixed.
     * dvt99439 - Fixed a vsim crash when a copy of class object is
       created inside another parameterized class say class B. And this
       class B or any of its super class extends the its own type
       parameter.
     * dvt99227 - Fixed a vopt crash when concatenation expression is used
       in the let statement. The concatenation expression contain the
       external declaration and let is in class task.
     * dvt98818 - Fixed a vsim crash when a real number is displayed as
       integer.
     * dvt98214 - If a signal 'say reg r' is updated with #0.xxx delay in
       a initial block which rounded to #0 delay and there is also an
       always block on r. Then the always block will also be executed with
       change in r.
     * dvt97683 - Fixed an invalid vsim-8304 when passing struct element
       to function ref argument through class virtual interface.
     * dvt97692 - Fixed a vopt crash when replication constant is
       calculated through some constant function with structure as
       argument.
     * dvt96735 - Fixed an invalid circular dependency error when value of
       a parameter in interface is calculated through constant function
       with argument as structure member.
     * dvt98834 - wreal nets were not being treated as a real type within
       certain expressions, leading to an "operator invalid for REAL"
       message being issued by the compiler.
     * dvt99463 - Fixed memory leak when forces on optimized cell ports
       are present.
     * dvt96138 - (results) Real values passed to a wire port used to
       report junk values, if read as it is. This is now fixed and the
       real value is now rounded of to nearest integer and then passed on
       to integer type port. Earlier, Questa used to support real values
       passed to port to be interpreted through $bitstoreal. This behavior
       is not supported anymore. For such a case to work, real values
       should first be converted to equivalent bits using $realtobits and
       then bits received at port should be read back using $bitstoreal.
     * dvt32206 - (results) $nochange timing check did not work properly
       in all cases.
     * dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an
       array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an
       internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic
       arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100885 - In some rare cases, randomize() will generate a
       spurious (vsim-7020) error "Illegal attempt to resize random
       dynamic array" when randomizing a dynamic array with
       -solvefaildebug enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100802 - Fixed compiler (vopt/vlog) crashes when DPI function
       calls are used in SystemVerilog constraints.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added a new suppressible error for the 'if'
       statement cases, in which condition expression is non singular
       type. Suppressible error will come with 'if' and 'else if' non
       singular condition expression cases.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added a new suppressible error 7080 for the
       non singular condition expressions in 'if' and 'else if'
       statements. For eg. reg ar[5]; if (ar) // non singular condition
       ... This will give suppressible error now.
     * dvt102251 - In some rare cases, randomize() would produce a
       solution that would violate an equality/inequality constraint
       between two random variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt88864 - (results) Fixs were made to SV extension -svext=iddp.
       For existing usage of vlog/vopt -svext=iddp, a recompilation from
       SV files is required due to this change.
     * [nodvtid] - Questa now supports "integral_number"s as a part of an
       "enum_identifier" within an "enum_name_declaration" production.
     * [nodvtid] - In fatal errors involving virtual interfaces Questa may
       have emitted an incorrect file number in the message.
     * dvt102853 - Fixed a simulator internal error when a DPI open array
       with an unsized packed dimension is used. The message is similar
       to: Questa has encountered an unexpected internal error:
       ../../src/vsim/svdpi_runtime.c(2216).
     * dvt17863 - Added support for the use of the 'array.size()' builtin
       function within the context of index expressions for random
       unpacked dynamic arrays/queues in constraints.
     * dvt104696 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one
       element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are
       different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.
     * dvt101989 - In some rare cases, randomize() would generate an
       invalid solution when evaluating constraint expressions of the
       following form: "arr.sum() with (int'(item == const_val))". This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt102459 - Iterative (foreach) constraints may now specify an
       array parameter instead of an array variable on which to iterate.
     * dvt102717 - In some rare cases, randomize() would ignore the 'with'
       clause associated with constraint expressions involving a builtin
       array reduction function (e.g. "foo.bar.sum() with
       (int'(item.baz))". This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt103611 - In some cases, randomize() scenarios involving large
       numbers of 'soft' constraints would solve slowly and/or fail due to
       memory allocation errors. Significant improvements to the
       constraint solver related to the evaluation of 'soft' constraints
       have been made, resolving these issues.
     * dvt103337 - (results) In the past, enabling -solvefaildebug=2 would
       often cause the solver to generate completely different randomize
       results from -solvefaildebug=[0|1]. Almost all of these issues have
       been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256,
       of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.
     * dvt94049 - The compiler incorrectly reported the following error
       when encountering an alias of an operator function instance:
** Error: Alias with operator symbol designator must denote a function.

       The compiler also incorrectly generated code for newly-defined
       operator functions with generic-typed parameters.
     * dvt89781 - For some specific cases in novopt mode, we used to do
       port collapsing optimization incorrectly. This has been fixed.
     * dvt90004 - In some specific cases of procedure inlining, vopt or
       vcom in novopt flow used to crash. This has been fixed.
     * dvt94831 - Added expected return type to the error message
       reporting overload resolution of a function call failed.
     * dvt93277 - The vmake command would not work when there was a
       dependency on an encrypted design unit.
     * dvt96070 - An error could occur if elaboration of a VHDL required a
       function call. To have an error the function would need to have a
       case statement where one or more of the case statement's choices
       are ranges.
     * dvt95670 - The attributes A'range and A'reverse_range would give
       incorrect ranges if A's bounds are defined with impure function
       calls.
     * dvt97035 - (results) In some cases, assignment statement within a
       for loop would have their line number changed to something else.
       This would result in incorrect coverage information being
       generated. Stepping through the loop would case the source display
       to jump to an incorrect line.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.
     * dvt97593 - Direct instantiation of an entity with a package
       instantiation in one of the generic map associations could cause
       incorrect code to be generated by the compiler, possibly leading to
       a loading failure message from the simulator.
     * dvt98805 - (source) In case, case generate, selected signal
       assignments, and selected variable assignments statements an error
       was not reported if the selector expression was a range. For
       example "CASE s'RANGE" would not result in an syntax error. It was
       either treated as length of the range or an internal error was
       reported from vcom or vopt.
     * dvt99166 - Writing a STRING to the FILE STD.TEXTIO.OUTPUT (which is
       stdout) using the function STD.TEXTIO.WRITE[TEXT,STRING] could
       result in a crash if the string contained two terminating LF (0x0a)
       characters.
     * dvt99443 - Record aggregate with OTHERS could result in a vcom or
       vopt crash if the expression was not of the same subtype as the
       record element(s) being associated.
     * dvt101286 - Fixed a bug where the default message printed using
       command 'assertion fail -print_msg' was always printing error
       message irrespective of the severity of the VHDL assertion. Now,
       the default message has the same severity as the severity specified
       for the assertion.
     * dvt101580 - Certain styles of continuous selected signal assignment
       statements with zero delay would not execute properly when
       optimized, either in an optimized design or a design compiled with
       the PE version of the product.
     * dvt103341 - (source) If the a bound of a range contained a function
       call, in some cases vcom failed to check to see if an actual
       argument to a function was in the subtype of the formal argument.
       This would occur if the actual argument was locally static and the
       formal's subtype was locally static. This would allow invalid code
       to execute. Depending how the function handle invalid argument
       values the simulation could generate errors or incorrect results.
     * dvt103675 - In some cases where are large number of objects are
       declared the order of declaration could negatively impact vcom
       performance.
     * dvt102732 - In some specific cases of mixed design where
       'last_value was used.Simulation use to give incorrect result under
       -mlopt option. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt104516 - (results) Predefined attribute S'LAST_VALUE could
       produce incorrect results if it was evaluated on a changing
       composite signal as deltas were occurring during the same timestep.
     * dvt103546 - The implicit matching operators for STD_ULOGIC, when
       the operands were locally static, would not be evaluated correctly
       by the compiler when performing an optimization to replace the
       expression with a known value
     * dvt103968 - Subprogram instantiation called with out-of-range
       actual would sometimes not be caught as an error.
     * dvt103025 - (results) In some specific cases of procedures being
       used before they are defined the tool was giving incorrect output.
       This has been fixed.
     * dvt67231 - Special characters in a comment that was inside an
       encrypted region could cause a parsing error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt92791 - Bug in the sccom distributed flow with missing systemc
       exported modules has been fixed.
     * dvt95642 - sccom merge error (sccom-6165) with a circular dependent
       forward declared module instantiation has been fixed.
     * dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow
       checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as
       the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active
       constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design
       has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported
       constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage
       that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.
       SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be
       recompiled with the 10.6a release.
     * dvt99466 - While trying to print the vsim-6577 error, for a
       sc_module, sc_port or a sc_prim_channel global or static SystemC
       object that is being destroyed at exit time, vsim might crash in
       some odd scenarios. This issue is now fixed. vsim will report a
       vsim-6522 warning instead and exit gracefully.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt101285 - (source) Fixed a bug where assertion control tasks
       (e.g. $assertoff) were not checking for the type of the argument
       for levels and accepting anything and using it as integer or
       defaulting to value 0. This resulted in incorrect behavior. Now we
       have added the check that the levels argument to these tasks has to
       be an integer expression. Any testcases where level was specified
       using incorrect type will need to be fixed.
     * dvt102346 - 'vsim -assertcover' has been renamed as 'vsim
       -assertcounts'. Note that this switch is not needed for assertion
       coverage (which is enabled by default). With 'vsim -assertcounts'
       we maintain various assertion counts (attempt, active, disable,
       vacuous, pass, fail).
     * dvt103855 - Assertion clocked with a clocking block variable fired
       incorrectly.
     * dvt104131 - Assertions using bit streaming operator did not
       evaluate correctly.
     * dvt102556 - vsim gave incorrect coverage result for (a ##1 b |-> c)
       type of properties.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was
       being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained
       a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in
       it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog
       but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now,
       the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI
       task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs
       failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs.
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt94450 - Fixed crash in VRM GUI when expanding Runnable tree with
       at least one repeat override specified.
     * dvt94326 - In the VRM GUI, the "Suspend/Terminate Selected Jobs"
       menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is running.
       Likewise, the "Resume Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none
       of the selected jobs is suspended.
     * dvt94708 - The Timeout spinners on the Runtime tab of the VRM
       Congifuration Edit dialog were too narrow to display timeout values
       consisting of four or more digits.
     * dvt93999 - Fixed problem where known-path parameters whose values
       were not absolute paths were not being expanded by the C/SQL API.
       Fixed error in TCL API path expansion when TCL-special characters
       were included in the path. Fixed TCL error in two path-expansion
       error messages.
     * dvt95137 - Fixed problem with the way non-standard normalizetime
       values (generally from transform rules) are displayed in the
       Results Analysis window.
     * dvt92310 - Fixed bug where VRM would crash if "-html" status-report
       option was added to a regular regression-run command line.
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt86860 - Fixed problem in VRM on Windows where cmd.exe and other
       utilities on the PATH could not be located.
     * dvt96255 - Fixed TCL error when using "vrun -kill" option to kill a
       regression test in testname mode.
     * dvt100091 - An SQL bug and a formatting bug that occurred if the
       "-hierarchical" command-line option was used to generate the VRM
       HTML status report have both been fixed. In addition, the
       non-hierarchical report and the hierarchical report both include
       the Runnable-type icons for consistency.
     * dvt101420 - Fixed an issue with the VRM status report algorithm
       where excessive time was spent maintaining on-the-fly status
       counters which were not even being used, resulting in slow loading
       of the status event log for very large regression runs.
     * dvt104125 - Fixed minor error in VRM in procedure which parses the
       Job ID from an RTDA log file.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt95199 - Element level checks controllability was not getting
       applied correctly for 'instances' specified in the config file.
       Corrected the same.
     * dvt95159 - Element level checks controllability was not getting
       applied correctly for 'instances' specified in the config file.
       Corrected the same.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.7
     * dvt93896 - The [wlfman filter] and [wlf2vcd] performance has been
       dramatically improved for WLF files containing large numbers of
       single bit Verilog nets.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt15443 - When vsim crashes with SIGSEGV signal, we were only
       giving HDL call stack. But, it wasn't complete stack in case of the
       crash in user's C code (like DPI/PLI etc). Now, vsim will generate
       stacktrace file and print full stacktrace in transcript as well, in
       addition to existing HDL call stack.
     * dvt94809 - Added switch "-pdupath[=&ltlib_path>]" which can be used
       with vsim to specify library path for PDU when library is moved
       after top level optimized design unit creation. If optional
       &ltlib_path> is not specified PDU will be looked into current
       working directory.
     * dvt85944 - While using -msglimit or -msglimitcount option,
       specified messages were suppressed silently after reaching the
       given limit. User will now see a note when limit is reached and
       specified message will no longer be printed.
** Note: (vsim-189) Message ID '8259' has reached the reporting limit of '4'. Th
is message will be suppressed now onwards.

     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt97716 - (results) Systemverilog Named Events now display a value
       in the GUI when examined or shown in any window where named items
       display values. The value for a Named Event will be the last
       simulation time the event was triggered. It will be displayed in
       the form "->@45 ns". If the event was never triggered, then the
       value "<no-events>" will be displayed.
     * dvt97716 - The "Assoc Array View" now displays the last event time
       for SV named event type array elements.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7
     * [nodvtid] - Use the vlog switch svext=+mttd to reinterpret ``"
       (tick-tick-double quote) as `" (tick-double quote) within macro
       text expansion.
     * [nodvtid] - Vlog can optionally ignore commas, ",", and right
       parens, ")", when found within a `" `" string that forms a list of
       macro argument actuals within another macro expansion. The
       -svext=+mtdl switch enables this behavior.
     * dvt96810 - (results) The new default vlog/vopt behavior to ignore
       PATHPULSE$ specparam's can be overriden by using the +pathpulse
       command line option.
     * dvt96548 - Allowed the parameter reference through virtual
       interface in part-select expression with -svext=aptviinexpr in
       vsim.
     * dvt98467 - Added a SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension to consider all fields of an unpacked struct as 'rand',
       regardless of whether an explicit 'rand' attribute is specified for
       the field or not. This extension is disabled by default. Enable
       this extension using the vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=+randstruct".
     * dvt62583 - Added a SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension which implements a non-LRM compliant form of 'rand_mode'
       for random unpacked arrays (fixed, dynamic, queues, associative).
       When this extension is enabled, every random unpacked array will
       keep track of its 'rand_mode' value independently of the
       'rand_mode' values of its elements. This extension is disabled by
       default. Enable this extension using the vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=+arraymode".
     * [nodvtid] - Parenthesis around a specify terminal descriptor are
       now recognized as an LRM extension. The SV parser will now accept
       parens when the error message 13290 is either suppressed or demoted
       to a warning.
     * dvt100020 - Added support for 'open_value_range' on the RHS of
       'dist' operator -- this allows ranges with '$' as lower or upper
       bound to be specified.
     * [nodvtid] - Added command line option +initwire to initialize the
       unconnected nets as per user input. Syntax of the option is
       +initwire[+0|1|X|Z] and can be given with vlog or vopt. Unconnected
       nets are initialized with 'z' by default, are initialized with the
       value given with option +initwire. If no value is given, i.e. only
       '+initwire' is given with vlog/vopt, then unconnected nets are
       initialized with '0'. Supported net types with this option are:
       wire, wor, wand, trior and triand. This option initializes
       unconnected nets whether declared as ports or normal variables in
       interface, module, program and package. For testcase: module
       top(input [4:0] w1); wire[5:0] w2; initial #1 $display("%b %b", w1,
       w2); endmodule Output without option: zzzzz zzzzzz Output with
       +initwire+0: 00000 000000
     * dvt100925 - Added support to allow port variables to be used before
       it is declared under -suppress 13299.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) always@(*) with delay or event usage inside
       the process will now trigger on bit/part/field-select of the
       variable instead of full variable. To disable this new behavior or
       go back to old release behavior, user can use 'vopt -svext=-basd'
       option.
     * dvt101596 -

-add_seq_delay < value > { < units >}


Specify a constant delay value for all sequential UDPs in the design.

If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is zero, new delay value will be used
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is higher, new delay value will be ign
ored.
If existing delay value of Sequential UDP is lower, new delay value will be repl
aced.
No other structural delay will be changed with this option.
Unit is optional, if not specified default unit will be used.


     * dvt78963 - Command affected: -msglimit. Now -msglimit error
       -msglimitcount < count >, will stop the Questa after "count" number
       of errors. -msglimit warning -msglimitcount < count >, will stop
       the Questa after "count" number of warnings.
     * [nodvtid] - Allow empty procedural case statements. I.e.: case
       statements with no branches defined. By default the vlog compiler
       will continue to emit an error when no branches are defined. This
       error is suppressible.
     * [nodvtid] - Vlog's command line option -svfilesuffix now accepts
       more characters as valid.
     * dvt73654 - Added support for random variables in index expressions
       for both packed and unpacked arrays in constraints. The vsim option
       "-svrandext=randindex" can be used to enable/disable this
       extension. This extension is enabled by default. This extension
       replaces the existing extension for random variable support in
       index expressions for packed arrays ("-svrandext=packrandidx" is
       deprecated).
     * dvt88366 - added two new options into "vcd add" command: -
       "-nocell" - "-l level" -nocell will suppress logging into cell -l
       level will be similar to the level in $dumpvar Usage: vcd add
       [-file ] [-dumpports] [-in] [-inout] [-internal] [-out] [-ports]
       [[-r] | [-r -optcells] | [-l level]] [-nocell] ...
     * [nodvtid] - Added vlog command line option to ignore System Verilog
       keyword and treat them as identifiers under option
       -ignoresvkeywords="keyword1[,keyword2]".
     * dvt103176 -
       Constraint solver vsim switch -solvefailseverity has been enhanced.
       The error message for randomize() failure and randomize(null)
       failure can be controlled separately with different severities. The
       existing usage of -solvefailseverity is not impacted.
       -solvefailseverity=<value1>[<value2>]
   Specify error message severity when randomize() and randomize(null) failures
are detected.
   When both <value1> and <value2> are present, <value1> specifies the severity
of randomize(),
   and <value2> specifies the severity for randomize(null). When only <value1> i
s present, the
   severity setting applies to both randomize() and randomize(null).
   Valid values for both <value1> and  <value2>:
      0 - no error
      1 - warning
      2 - error
      3 - failure
      4 - fatal

       The companion modelsim.ini variable has been enhanced for the
       similar change.
     * dvt5888 - Questa now supports reading vector based port
       declarations in evcd file. The option to read this file is -vcdstim
       which is an existing option. There is no additional option needed
       to use this functionality. Vector based evcd file can be generated
       from Questa using +dumpports+collapse option.
     * dvt104016 - (results) Improved the readability of the solver
       profile report by removing details that are not relevant to
       performance, along with the following improvements: - display CPU
       time in seconds (instead of ticks) - display CPU time stats for top
       10 individual calls for each callsite
     * [nodvtid] - Significantly improved performance and memory use
       related to randomize() scenarios evaluated by the BDD solver
       engine.
     * dvt100019 - Added SystemVerilog extension to improve support for
       function calls in constraints with complex interactions between the
       function input(s) and function output by allowing functions to be
       called multiple times. Specify vsim command line option
       "-svrandext=funcback" to enable this extension.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Enhancements in 10.7
     * [nodvtid] - sccom has a new option '-sctop <sc_module_name>'. This
       option should be used along with the '-nodebug' option. Every
       SystemC module specified with the
       SC_EXPORT_MODULE(<sc_module_name>) macro should be specified on the
       sccom command line with the '-sctop <sc_module_name>' option during
       compilation, e.g: sccom -sctop <top_1> -sctop <top_2> ... <other
       sccom options>.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt100099 - Added a new option -print_msg in 'assertion fail'
       command to print default error message all the time when assertion
       fails. This default message is printed irrespective of what is
       specified in the action block. If there is no action block, then
       only this default message is printed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt90645 - (results) Wildcard bins are now supported in covergroup
       crosses.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The UDP Coverage is not a recommended
       coverage collection metric and has been deprecated in 10.7. The
       following suppressible error message appears when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected in 10.7,
       "** Error (suppressible): (vlog-192) UDP expression coverage has
       been deprecated and will be removed in future releases."
       The user can still use UDP coverage feature by suppressing the
       error, however it will be removed completely in future releases.
     * dvt79889 - (results) Few toggle related vsim options have been
       deprecated in 10.7 and will be removed in future releases. These
       options are listed below:
       1. -togglemaxfixedsizearray
       2. -togglefixedsizearray
       3. -togglevlogints
       4. -notogglevlogints
       5. -notogglefixedsizearray
       Following warning messages will appear if these options are used:
       ** Warning: (vsim-12116) "-togglefixedsizearray" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12116) "-togglemaxfixedsizearray" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12116) "-notogglefixedsizearray" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12117) "-togglevlogints" option is now deprecated
       and will be removed in future releases.
       ** Warning: (vsim-12117) "-notogglevlogints" option is now
       deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.7
     * [nodvtid] - The "-debug" option on the vrun command may now
       optionally take the form "-debug=" where "flags" is a
       comma-separated list of debug flags. The only debug flag supported
       currently is "usertcl" which will cause a message to be emitted
       before and after any usertcl procedure is executed. The legacy
       "-debug" option behaves as before.
     * [nodvtid] - The TCL status report from VRM now includes total and
       testplan coverage data (per mergefile). All status reports now
       report coverage from VRM status event log instead of re-reading the
       merged UCDB file.
     * dvt66359 - VRM now supports parallel auto-merge. The feature is
       activated by specifying "-parallelmerge <n>" where <n> is the
       maximum number of concurrent merge operations allowed for a single
       mergefile. In addition, the auto-merge algorithm will defer the
       launching of merges with less than 5 input UCDBs until the minimum
       of 5 UCDBs are queued or until 30 seconds pass with no additional
       UCDBs being queued.
     * [nodvtid] - VRM now supports modifying the mimetype and encoding of
       emails sent from within vrun by modifying certain pre-defined
       parameters in the RMDB.
     * dvt101404 - (results) Normally it is an error to delete test from a
       test-associated UCDB merge file. This change allows that error to
       be suppressed.
How to suppress:

A) Deletion of test from a merge UCDB

    Under a call like:
        vsim -suppress 6892 -viewcov < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb
    deletions WILL be allowed:
        coverage edit -delete -test < name of test with no coverage >

B) Future accumulations to the merge file will require an additional suppression
:
        vcover merge -suppress 6891 -testassociated -out
            < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb < accumulation_mergefile >.ucdb x.uc
db

     * dvt101747 - (source) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >'
       command, the '-showattr' argument has been deprecated in favor of
       the '-attribute' argument. Additionally, the '-attributeAll'
       argument is now supported.
     * dvt101748 - (results) For the 'vcover report ... < rank file >'
       command, the '-nononcontrib' and '-nosummary' arguments are now
       supported.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt97428 - Following enhancements have been made in 'power on reset
       assertion': Non-Retention Register Reset : Current Implementation:
       (vopt -pa_checks=npu): Checks that non-retention registers are
       reset when the power domain containing them is powered up. Sample
       error message: ** Error: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 12 ns,
       Asynchronous (set/reset) control for the following flop(s) of power
       domain 'PD1' is not asserted at power up: # /tb/top_inst/out1. #
       File: test.upf, Line: 4, Power Domain:PD1 Updated Implementation:
       User can specify following 2 design attributes to add timing
       control in 'power on reset' assertion: set_design_attributes
       -attribute qpa_attr_inactive_reset_duration Tmax
       set_design_attributes -attribute qpa_attr_active_reset_duration
       Twidth If these attributes are defined, then 'Power on reset'
       assertions shall be defined as following: QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: (vopt
       -pa_checks=npu) : 1) Checks that Asynchronous Reset must be
       asserted within Tmax time units after power-up. 2) Checks that
       Asynchronous Reset must not be deasserted before Twidth time units
       after getting asserted. Sample Error Messages: # ** Error:
       (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 16 ns, Asynchronous(set/reset)
       control for the following flop(s) in scope '/tb/top_inst' of power
       domain 'PD0' is not asserted within 4 time-units after power up: #
       out2, # out[0], # out[1], # File: ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line: 4,
       Power Domain:PD0 # ** Note: (vsim-8912) QPA_NRET_ASYNCFF: Time: 19
       ns, Asynchronous(set/reset) control for the following flop(s) in
       scope '/tb/top_inst' of power domain 'PD0' is deasserted within 3
       time-units after getting asserted: # out1, # out5. # File:
       ./src/npu_chk3/test.upf, Line: 4, Power Domain:PD0 If these
       attributes are not defined, we fall back to original behavior.
     * dvt97427 - All Low power messages can be redirected to a specified
       file (in stead of default transcript) by means of vsim option
       -pa_logfile
     * dvt103645 - (results) Added an option -noreg in vsim "power add"
       command. This will disable dumping of switching activity of design
       elements which are inferred as registers e.g.
       regs/logic/bits/functions etc.
     * [nodvtid] - Added the support for UPF 3.0 HDL package functions.
       Following are the details of the functions supported. HDL access
       functions: - upf_get_handle_by_name - upf_query_object_properties -
       upf_iter_get_next Immediate read access functions: -
       upf_get_value_int - upf_get_value_str - get_supply_value -
       get_supply_voltage - get_supply_on_state - get_supply_state
       Immediate write access functions: - supply_on - supply_off -
       supply_partial_on - set_supply_state Continuous access function: -
       upf_create_object_mirror - Only read access is supported. Utility
       functions: - upf_query_object_type - upf_query_object_pathname For
       the function upf_query_object_properties, not all the objects and
       properties are supported. Please refer to the user doc to get the
       details.

   WLF and VCD logging Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt94883 - In post-sim mode (vsim -view), The 'Cover Directives'
       window is now populated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   MC2 Enhancements in 10.7
     * dvt98025 - In some scenarios, user may need to pass additional vlog
       options to mc2com's interface file compilation. User can now pass
       all such options through -mc2vlogargs in mc2com.
  -mc2vlogargs  Specify vlog options for MC2 interface file compilation.
