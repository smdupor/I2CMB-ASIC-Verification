   Release Announcements in 10.6a
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5
            x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release,
            gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for
            SystemC have been discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
            limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
          + (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
            deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
            deprecation process:
               o The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a
                 deprecation warning message.
               o In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will
                 be disabled and cause error messages to be emitted.
               o Customer scripts using this switch will have to be
                 changed. This legacy switch forces incremental mode
                 (pre-6.0 behavior) which is sub-optimal, and it is no
                 longer maintained.
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser
                 PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
                 documentation are fully functional.
                 Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
                 result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
                 current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the
                 PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all
                 web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of
                 this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals
                 is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
                 page-oriented layout.
                 Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate
                 between topics, and click links to examples, videos,
                 reference material, and other related technical content.

                 Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available
                 options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on
                 SupportNet.
                 Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the
                 U.S. and other countries.
               o In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows
                 8.1 will be dropped.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6a
       SystemVerilog Compatibility

     * dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an
       optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.
     * dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could
       drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1
       primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value)
       drive a single output port.

   SystemC Compatibility
     * dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow
       checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as
       the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active
       constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design
       has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported
       constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage
       that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.
       SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be
       recompiled with the 10.6a release.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was
       being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained
       a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in
       it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog
       but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now,
       the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI
       task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs
       failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs.
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt93487 - (source) The profile on command no longer clears
       previous results. The profile clear command must be used when
       switching between the performance profiler and memory profiler.
     * dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the
       status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning
       is issued if more than one option is provided.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt90802 - (results) The 'createcovitem' option is now the default
       for the xml2ucdb tool. A new 'nocreatecovitem' option is now
       supported to override this default if desired.

   User Interface Compatibility
     * dvt97034 - (results) A new radix flag has been added called
       "wreal". With this radix option enabled, real number NaN values
       will display as X or Z instead of "nan". If the nan internal value
       matches `wrealZState, then a 'Z' will be shown, otherwise an 'X'
       will be shown. This effects all windows and commands that display
       or return simulation values. The [radix] command or the command
       "set DefaultRadixFlags wreal" can be used to enable or disable this
       option. This option is disabled by default.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            warning message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will be
            disabled and cause error messages to be emitted.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
       ___________________________________________________________________

       General Defects Repaired in 10.6a

     * dvt94966 - The capstat command and options have been redesigned.
       The capstat option for vsim is as follows:
   -capstats[=&ltargs>[,]]   Enables capstats report
                           &ltargs> are du, decl, line, eor and filename=&ltfile
name>.
                           Arguments are specified separated by comma.
                           The argument du has suboptions: summary, details and
duname=&ltduname>
                           These suboptions can be specified separated by '+'

       The capstat comamnd is as follows:
capstats [-du [+summary | +details] [+duname=&ltduname>]] [-decl] [-line] [-file
name &ltfilename>]
       If no option is specified, capstats prints summary report under top
       categories.
       A design unit based breakup of memory can be seen by specifying -du
       option. For extra details, summary or details options can be used.
       Specific design units can be specified using duname suboption. If
       design units are specified, then design unit based report is
       generated only for the specified design units.
       -decl option prints declaration based report for dynamic objects.
       -line option prints line based report for dynamic objects.
     * dvt95319 - "vopt" can crash when using -debugdb and the path name
       to the "work" library is very long and the top designunit name is
       also very long. This problem has been resolved.
     * dvt93487 - (source) The profile on command no longer clears
       previous results. The profile clear command must be used when
       switching between the performance profiler and memory profiler.
     * dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the
       status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning
       is issued if more than one option is provided.
     * dvt96193 - The profile summary command now displays an 'Other'
       field that displays the number of samples not counted in the listed
       categories.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt92169 - Objects window Kind filtering was not being restored
       correctly after a restart operation.
     * dvt89554 - Use of "examine -time" inside a "when -fast" command
       fails to read data values correctly. This issues has been resolved.
     * dvt94499 - Running vsim from a .BAT file on Windows can fail when
       some arguments contain a trailing backslash ('\'). This issue has
       been resolved.
     * dvt94465 - The Code Coverage Analysis window does not track by-file
       toggle coverage. This is intended as by-file toggle coverage is not
       supported. The CCA window will not display a message to this effect
       when the window is in by-file mode.
     * dvt95571 - The GUI will crash when trying to perform wildcard
       expansion in a Primitive scope. This issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an
       optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.
     * [nodvtid] - SDF annotation fails with array port when zero timing
       delay is specified in SDF. If sdf has non-zero then annotations
       went fine. Fixed so that annotations proceed even if sdf file has
       zero delays.
     * [nodvtid] - vlog's -E output might incorrectly emit
       "`pragmaprotect" rather than "`pragma" whitespace "protect".
     * dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could
       drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1
       primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value)
       drive a single output port.
     * dvt96162 - Simulation mismatch with different full optimization
       when using delayed clocking Blocks.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt94049 - The compiler incorrectly reported the following error
       when encountering an alias of an operator function instance:
** Error: Alias with operator symbol designator must denote a function.

       The compiler also incorrectly generated code for newly-defined
       operator functions with generic-typed parameters.
     * dvt89781 - For some specific cases in novopt mode, we used to do
       port collapsing optimization incorrectly. This has been fixed.
     * dvt90004 - In some specific cases of procedure inlining, vopt or
       vcom in novopt flow used to crash. This has been fixed.
     * dvt94831 - Added expected return type to the error message
       reporting overload resolution of a function call failed.
     * dvt93277 - The vmake command would not work when there was a
       dependency on an encrypted design unit.
     * dvt96070 - An error could occur if elaboration of a VHDL required a
       function call. To have an error the function would need to have a
       case statement where one or more of the case statement's choices
       are ranges.
     * dvt95670 - The attributes A'range and A'reverse_range would give
       incorrect ranges if A's bounds are defined with impure function
       calls.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt92791 - Bug in the sccom distributed flow with missing systemc
       exported modules has been fixed.
     * dvt95642 - sccom merge error (sccom-6165) with a circular dependent
       forward declared module instantiation has been fixed.
     * dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow
       checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as
       the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active
       constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design
       has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported
       constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage
       that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.
       SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be
       recompiled with the 10.6a release.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt95904 - Assertion shows INACTIVE in the waveform even when it is
       ACTIVE.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was
       being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained
       a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in
       it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog
       but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now,
       the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI
       task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs
       failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs.
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt94450 - Fixed crash in VRM GUI when expanding Runnable tree with
       at least one repeat override specified.
     * dvt94326 - In the VRM GUI, the "Suspend/Terminate Selected Jobs"
       menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is running.
       Likewise, the "Resume Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none
       of the selected jobs is suspended.
     * dvt94708 - The Timeout spinners on the Runtime tab of the VRM
       Congifuration Edit dialog were too narrow to display timeout values
       consisting of four or more digits.
     * dvt93999 - Fixed problem where known-path parameters whose values
       were not absolute paths were not being expanded by the C/SQL API.
       Fixed error in TCL API path expansion when TCL-special characters
       were included in the path. Fixed TCL error in two path-expansion
       error messages.
     * dvt95137 - Fixed problem with the way non-standard normalizetime
       values (generally from transform rules) are displayed in the
       Results Analysis window.
     * dvt92310 - Fixed bug where VRM would crash if "-html" status-report
       option was added to a regular regression-run command line.
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt86860 - Fixed problem in VRM on Windows where cmd.exe and other
       utilities on the PATH could not be located.
     * dvt96255 - Fixed TCL error when using "vrun -kill" option to kill a
       regression test in testname mode.

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.6a
     * dvt93896 - The [wlfman filter] and [wlf2vcd] performance has been
       dramatically improved for WLF files containing large numbers of
       single bit Verilog nets.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.6a
     * dvt94809 - Added switch "-pdupath[=&ltlib_path>]" which can be used
       with vsim to specify library path for PDU when library is moved
       after top level optimized design unit creation. If optional
       &ltlib_path> is not specified PDU will be looked into current
       working directory.

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.6a
     * dvt88977 - "Add" -> "To Watch" has been added to the Source window
       popup menu.
     * dvt23220 - The "radix" command will now accept HEXADECIMAL to
       indicate displaying base 16 numeric values using uppercase A-F
       characters. The of "hexadecimal" in lowercase will continue to
       display base 16 numeric values using lowercase a-f characters.
     * dvt95331 - The color of the selected items highlight in the Wave
       window scrollbar can be changed by setting
       PrefWave(mapSelectColor).
     * dvt97034 - (results) A new radix flag has been added called
       "wreal". With this radix option enabled, real number NaN values
       will display as X or Z instead of "nan". If the nan internal value
       matches `wrealZState, then a 'Z' will be shown, otherwise an 'X'
       will be shown. This effects all windows and commands that display
       or return simulation values. The [radix] command or the command
       "set DefaultRadixFlags wreal" can be used to enable or disable this
       option. This option is disabled by default.

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6a
     * [nodvtid] - Use the vlog switch svext=+mttd to reinterpret ``"
       (tick-tick-double quote) as `" (tick-double quote) within macro
       text expansion.
     * [nodvtid] - Vlog can optionally ignore commas, ",", and right
       parens, ")", when found within a `" `" string that forms a list of
       macro argument actuals within another macro expansion. The
       -svext=+mtdl switch enables this behavior.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.6a
     * [nodvtid] - The UDP Coverage Support will be removed in future
       releases as it is not a recommended coverage collection metric. The
       following deprecation warning message will appear when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected from 10.6a onwards, "UDP Expression Coverage
       is not a recommended Coverage Collection Metrics. It will be
       deprecated in Future releases."
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.6a
     * [nodvtid] - The "-debug" option on the vrun command may now
       optionally take the form "-debug=" where "flags" is a
       comma-separated list of debug flags. The only debug flag supported
       currently is "usertcl" which will cause a message to be emitted
       before and after any usertcl procedure is executed. The legacy
       "-debug" option behaves as before.
     * [nodvtid] - The TCL status report from VRM now includes total and
       testplan coverage data (per mergefile). All status reports now
       report coverage from VRM status event log instead of re-reading the
       merged UCDB file.
     * dvt90802 - (results) The 'createcovitem' option is now the default
       for the xml2ucdb tool. A new 'nocreatecovitem' option is now
       supported to override this default if desired.
