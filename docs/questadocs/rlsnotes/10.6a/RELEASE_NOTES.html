There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>
 <li>(source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be deprecated in the next major 
release 10.7 following normal deprecation process:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
warning message. 
<li>In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will be disabled 
and cause error messages to be emitted.
<li>Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
</li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>
For information about Adobe's discontinued support of Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on SupportNet.<br><br>
Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows 8.1 will be dropped. </li>

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.</li>
 <li>dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1 primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value) drive a single output port.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemC  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error. SystemC designs compiled with the 10.6 release will need to be recompiled with the 10.6a release.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now, the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs. </li>
 <li>dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read, correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt93487 - (source) The profile on command no longer clears previous results. The profile clear command must be used when switching between the performance profiler and memory profiler.</li>
 <li>dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning is issued if more than one option is provided.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not supported.
Such an action would break the integrity of the bin counts in the database.
An error message is issued when an attempt is made to delete a test while using
'coverage edit -delete -test < test name >'.</li>
 <li>dvt90802 - (results) The 'createcovitem' option is now the default for the xml2ucdb tool.
A new 'nocreatecovitem' option is now supported to override this default if desired.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>User Interface  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt97034 - (results) A new radix flag has been added called "wreal".  With this radix option enabled, real number NaN values will display as X or Z instead of "nan". If the nan internal value matches `wrealZState, then a 'Z' will be shown, otherwise an 'X' will be shown.  This effects all windows and commands that display or return simulation values.  The [radix] command or the command "set DefaultRadixFlags wreal" can be used to enable or disable this option.  This option is disabled by default.</li>
</ul>

<p /><a name="generaldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>General Defects Repaired in 10.6a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt94966 - The capstat command and options have been redesigned. The capstat option for vsim is as follows:<br><pre>
   -capstats[=&ltargs&gt[,]]   Enables capstats report
                           &ltargs&gt are du, decl, line, eor and filename=&ltfilename&gt.
                           Arguments are specified separated by comma.
                           The argument du has suboptions: summary, details and duname=&ltduname&gt
                           These suboptions can be specified separated by '+'
</pre>

The capstat comamnd is as follows:<br> <pre>
capstats [-du [+summary | +details] [+duname=&ltduname&gt]] [-decl] [-line] [-filename &ltfilename&gt]</pre>
<br>
If no option is specified, capstats prints summary report under top categories. 
<br>A design unit based breakup of memory can be seen by specifying -du option. For extra details, summary or details options can be used. Specific design units can be specified using duname suboption. If design units are specified, then design unit based report is generated only for the specified design units. 
<br>
-decl option prints declaration based report for dynamic objects.
<br>
-line option prints line based report for dynamic objects.</li>
 <li>dvt95319 - "vopt" can crash when using -debugdb and the path name to the "work" library is very long and the top designunit name is also very long.  This problem has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt93487 - (source) The profile on command no longer clears previous results. The profile clear command must be used when switching between the performance profiler and memory profiler.</li>
 <li>dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning is issued if more than one option is provided.</li>
 <li>dvt96193 - The profile summary command now displays an 'Other' field that displays the number of samples not counted in the listed categories. </li>

<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt92169 - Objects window Kind filtering was not being restored correctly after a restart operation.</li>
 <li>dvt89554 - Use of "examine -time" inside a "when -fast" command fails to read data values correctly.  This issues has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt94499 - Running vsim from a .BAT file on Windows can fail when some arguments contain a trailing backslash ('\').  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt94465 - The Code Coverage Analysis window does not track by-file toggle coverage.  This is intended as by-file toggle coverage is not supported.  The CCA window will not display a message to this effect when the window is in by-file mode.</li>
 <li>dvt95571 - The GUI will crash when trying to perform wildcard expansion in a Primitive scope.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

<ul><li>dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - SDF annotation fails with array port when zero timing delay is specified in SDF. If sdf has non-zero then annotations went fine. Fixed so that annotations proceed even if sdf file has zero delays.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - vlog's -E output might incorrectly emit "`pragmaprotect" rather than "`pragma" whitespace "protect".</li>
 <li>dvt96999 - (results) Optimized full timing gate-level cells could drive incorrect values where 2 wired bufif0/bufif1/notif0/notif1 primitives with shared selects (select having an X or Z value) drive a single output port.</li>
 <li>dvt96162 - Simulation mismatch with different full optimization when using delayed clocking Blocks. </li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt94049 - The compiler incorrectly reported the following error when encountering an alias of an operator function instance:
<pre>
** Error: Alias with operator symbol designator must denote a function.
</pre>
The compiler also incorrectly generated code for newly-defined operator functions with generic-typed parameters.</li>
 <li>dvt89781 - For some specific cases in novopt mode, we used to do port collapsing optimization incorrectly. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt90004 - In some specific cases of procedure inlining, vopt or vcom in novopt flow used to crash. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt94831 - Added expected return type to the error message reporting overload resolution of a function call failed.</li>
 <li>dvt93277 - The vmake command would not work when there was a dependency on an encrypted design unit.</li>
 <li>dvt96070 - An error could occur if elaboration of a VHDL required a function call.  To have an error the function would need to have a case statement where one or more of the case statement's choices are ranges.</li>
 <li>dvt95670 - The attributes A'range and A'reverse_range would give incorrect ranges if A's bounds are defined with impure function calls.</li>

 <li>dvt95642 - sccom merge error (sccom-6165) with a circular dependent forward declared module instantiation has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt81733 - (results) vsim option '-scchkpntrestore' will allow checkpoint/restore feature with SystemC in the design as long as the SystemC hierarchy is dummy wrapper without any active constructs like signals, variables, processes etc. If the design has active SystemC usage, vsim will try to ignore the unsupported constructs and proceed with the simulation, but if there is a usage that cannot be ignored, vsim will throw a fatal run time error.

<ul><li>dvt94450 - Fixed crash in VRM GUI when expanding Runnable tree with at least one repeat override specified.</li>
 <li>dvt94326 - In the VRM GUI, the "Suspend/Terminate Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is running. Likewise, the "Resume Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is suspended.</li>
 <li>dvt94708 - The Timeout spinners on the Runtime tab of the VRM Congifuration Edit dialog were too narrow to display timeout values consisting of four or more digits.</li>
 <li>dvt93999 - Fixed problem where known-path parameters whose values were not absolute paths were not being expanded by the C/SQL API. Fixed error in TCL API path expansion when TCL-special characters were included in the path. Fixed TCL error in two path-expansion error messages.</li>
 <li>dvt95137 - Fixed problem with the way non-standard normalizetime values (generally from transform rules) are displayed in the Results Analysis window.</li>
