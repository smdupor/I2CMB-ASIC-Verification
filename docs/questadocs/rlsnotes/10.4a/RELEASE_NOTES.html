<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.4a.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - <br>
[10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been discontinued.<br>
[10.4] Licensing Information
<p>There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.

<p>However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and older,
please note the following:

<ul><li>Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The 
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will 
be FLEXnet version 11.11.1.1.
<li>For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
<li>If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
</ul><br>
[10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.<br>
[10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology) library, sources and documentation have been updated to version 2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.<br>
[10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.<br>
[10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.1] Support for GCC versions gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.<br>
<br>
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Accellera UVM Version 1.2 has been integrated with this release.</li>

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Key Information Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt73631 - (results) VHDL 2008 users who use generic packages or subprograms must refresh the associated design units or recompile from source code with this release.  Changes made for correctness affect internal data structures and are incompatible with vhdl-2008 design units generated with earlier releases.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt35312 - (source, results) The following new non-standard string methods will be supported:<br>
1) match() : Returns 1 if a specified  regex pattern is found in the string,else returns 0.<br>
2) search() : This function searches for the specified  pattern in the string and returns the integer index to the beginning of the pattern.<br>
3) prematch() : This function returns the string before the matched pattern, based on the last call to match().<br>
4) postmatch() : This function returns the string after the matched pattern, based on the last call to match().<br>
5) thismatch() : This function returns the matched string, based on the last call to match().<br>
6) backref() : This function returns matched patterns,based on the index specified, starting from 0. The indices correspond to the sequence of parenthesis specified in the pattern, i.e., 0 corresponds to the first set of round  parenthesis encountered in the pattern from left to right, 1 to the second, and so on. <br>
<br>

Since these are non-standard functions, error will be generated if -pedanticerrors is used for compilation.<br>
All regexes will use perl pattern syntax.</li>
 <li>dvt73252 - (results) When the default specify path delay values were smaller than the annotated SDF RETAIN delay values, vsim-SDF-8745 warning was incorrectly issued.</li>
 <li>dvt73170 - (results) When a specify path, with a destination port driven by a Verilog "reg" variable, was annotated SDF RETAIN delays and vsim options +vlog_retain_on, +vlog_retain_same2same_on and -voptargs="+acc" were specified, vsim crashed.</li>
 <li>dvt73542 - (results) Gate-level optimized cells with cascading sequential udps may under some conditions not evaluate correctly.</li>
 <li>dvt74257 - (results) Using the associative array method 'exists' with a wildcard array inside a parameterized class, or through an external reference, could result in an incorrect 'false' result.</li>
 <li>dvt71774 - (results) A simulation invoked with an elab or a checkpoint file from 3-step flow (with SDF file specified to vopt), would not reload SDF on "restart -f".
</li>
 <li>dvt74219 - (results) Calling a builtin queue or associative array method on an out-of-bounds array element could result in a non-useful error.  We now print a warning, and ignore the operation.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Command line force did not support string types. This is now fixed.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) The VPI object model has been more fully implemented, with additional queries on class typespecs and a few other types now working.</li>
 <li>dvt68123 - (results) Improved handling of randomize() timeouts. Specify solver timeout threshold (in seconds) using any of the following methods:
  - vsim command line option: "-solvetimeout <value>"
  - modelsim.ini [vsim] variable: "SolveTimeout=<value>"
  - Verilog attribute: "solvetimeout=<value>"
A randomize() call will fail if the CPU time required to evaluate any randset exceeds the specified timeout. The default value is 500. A value of 0 will disable timeout failures.
</li>
 <li>dvt69371 - (results) Made the vlog error 2745 suppressible. This is an enhancement to support the following non-LRM behaviour.

<pre>
class A#(parameter type T = int);
  int i = 1;
endclass

module top();
  initial begin
   $display("i = %d" , A::i); // This is an error w.r.t. LRM . This change suppresses the error and allows it
  end
endmodule
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SVA/PSL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt70597 - (source, results) Multiple issues and crashes with $display/$sformatf/$error/$warning were fixed. A new switch -svext=[+|-]expdfmt has been added. This is off by default. When turned on, it leads to the following: 
<br>
1) Format specifiers in string variables, passed to $display will be interpreted as format specifiers and not normal strings. For example for the following snippet:<br>
<br>
  string s1 = "%d";<br>
  initial<br>
       $display(s1, 40);<br>

The output would be :<br>
<br>
#40<br>
<br>
Instead of:<br>
<br>
#%d    40<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) For $sformatf, arguments outnumbering the number of format specifiers will be  appended to the return string<br>

For example, for the following function call:<br>

$sformatf("%d", 40,40);<br>

The return string will be:"40   40" instead of "40" as before.
</li>
 <li>dvt74394 - (results) When SVA accept_on/sync_accept_on expression is true it will result in real passes (instead of vacuous passes).  Pass action blocks are rare but if an assertion using these properties has a pass action block then this action block will be triggered with this change.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt72760 - (results) In a mixed language design with a verilog switch network the extended VCD output for a VHDL signal was not calculated properly.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt70536 - (results) In some cases, verilog foreach construct shows invalid branches in coverage report.Fixed them.</li>
 <li>dvt75045 - (results) REC coverage shows different hit counts for rows with same input patterns. This happens for expressions involving ternary operators and when vopt is run with coveropt 1.It has been fixed now.</li>
 <li>dvt63793 - (results) Coverage pragma exclusion (fine grain as well as simple //coverage off ) wasn't working for exclusion of branches from ternary expressions. Fixed them.</li>
 <li>dvt74258 - (results) The -uvmtestname and -ovmtestname options are added in vsim to use +UVM_TESTNAME and +OVM_TESTNAME names in coverstore testnames and data file names. Specified SV seed values are also added in coverstore test names and
data file names by default.</li>
 <li>dvt75139 - (results) Covered bins, missing bins, total bins, and "% Hit" are added in covergroup text report for covergroup TYPEs and covergroup instances. Those are also added for TYPE coverpoints and crosses in covergroups having merge_instances=0. The "% Hit" number is also added for all coverpoints and crosses.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt74716 - (results) <pre>
The assert scope requires some special case processing to compute "total coverage" for an assertion:
    If an assertion has both pass and fail counts
        It is 100% if pass count > 0 and fail count == 0
    else if it has only fail count:
        It is 100% if fail count == 0
    	 
The UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST element of the summary record represents this percentage.

The ranktest tool will use and report the 'UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST' metric (when possible). If there is any assertion failure in any test, it is a bug/problem that must be addressed by the user.

Until ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will use the "%success metric" like the rest of our reporting tools.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. The "%success" metric will be reported in the "Assertions" column. 

After ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will ignore the "%success" metric in its calculations.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will NOT agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. A "-" will be reported in the "Assertions" column.
 4. A warning message similar to the following will be issued: 

** Warning: (vcover-17208) One or more tests contain "assertion failures".
Ranktest will not include "assertion successes" in its ranking metric
calculations (i.e. "assertion successes" will be weighted as 0).

As a consequence, the ranking total coverage metric may be different from the total coverage numbers of other Questa GUI and CLI tools. The reason for this alteration is that the "%success" metric is now exhibiting a NON-monotonically increasing behavior and can no longer be used in the ranktest "greedy" algorithm. Ranktest will NOT use the "assertion pass" metric in any way (neither with nor without assertion failures). </li>
 <li>dvt75521 - (results) Fixed a defect that caused statement coverage to be skipped when statement coverage was explicitly selected along with other coverage types. This effect many of the "coverage ..." command supporting the "-code ..." argument. EXAMPLE ARGUMENT: "-code st".</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Previously, there was a switch in the HTML report command called "-duonly". Using this switch, the report will include DUs information and suppress anything else. Now this switch is deprecated. From now on, when using this switch, the switch will be ignored with a warning message, but the report be generated normally (without suppressing any thing). Notice that the user can obtain the same effect of "-duonly" but when using another group of switches, those are; "-noinstance" and "-notestplan". Using those two switches together has the same of effect of the old switch "-duonly".</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) We have a switch in the HTML report generation command called "-instance <inst path>". Previously, using this switch will suppress all information form the HTML report except information related to the specified instance. In 10.4 we have changed the behavior of this switch. Now, this switch will suppress information related to all instances except the specified instance, but other information related to DUs and the testplan will be generated normally. Notice that the user can still have the same effect of the old "-instance <inst path>" but when using additional two switches; "-nodu" and "-notestplan".</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>User Interface  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (results) A new feature called VHDL Access Path Expressions has been introduced which provides improved visibility and a more intuitive way of viewing VHDL access variables and objects in the Wave Window.  Some of the features of vhdl access path expressions are:<ul>
<li>More descriptive pointer values.  Values are Dynamic Object Identifiers instead of hexadecimal memory address.</li>
<li>Access references may be expanded in place in the wave window rather than having to inspect individual access objects one by one.</li>
<li>Ability to add access_var.all to see dereferenced object values.</li>
<li>Ability to "cast" unconstrained arrays to constrained array type.</li>
<li>The [accessinfo] command gives metrix and reports about access object usage.</li>
<li>Enabled with -accessobjdebug switch or AccessObjDebug modelsim.ini variable setting.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Release Announcements Compatibility</b></font></dd>

 <li>dvt71423 - Fixed an issue related to recursive instance having generate loops further having VHDL or Verilog instances. In these cases we either get errors like 'code not found' in vsim or 'failed to access library' or 'unable to load design unit' during vopt.</li>
 <li>dvt73051 - Fixed elaboration crash with subelement association. The formal must be an element or subelement of a multidimensional port and the actually a 2008 signal expression.</li>
 <li>dvt72382 - Optimized mode was not reporting multiply driven unresolved signals in rare instances of driving package signals.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Aggregates of signals in subprograms, either as parameters to other subprogram, or as targets of signal assignments could cause a crash if the aggregate contained both parameters and non-parameter signals.</li>
 <li>dvt73471 - (source) Symbols defined only in the body of an uninstantiated package were accessible to other design units either through a USE clause or explicit scope identification. Customer designs that previously took advantage of this error, referencing symbols defined only in package bodies, need to be changed to either remove the offending references, or move the declarations of the symbols to their uninstantiated package headers.</li>
 <li>dvt74036 - vopt would crash if an object from an instance of a generic package was used within a configuration.</li>
 <li>dvt74124 - Vcom could fail with an internal error when a port map statement is present on a block</li>
 <li>dvt74313 - If an attribute that returned a range is used as the expression to a return statement, incorrect machine code could be generated. A range is not a valid return value and is now flagged as an error a compile time.</li>
 <li>dvt63309 - In some cases vopt would generate a unexpected message about null ranges. Like:<br>
# ** Warning: [3] test.vhd(3): (vopt-1246) Range 1 to 0 is null. <br>
The number of these messages have been greatly reduced.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Logging of composite type variables with embedded access type subelements would sometimes not detect and record changes to those subelements.</li>
 <li>dvt75643 - Performance of designs that perform many file open/close operations could degrade significantly when transitioning from any version prior to 10.4 to 10.4. File open/close processing has been improved to eliminate this degradation.</li>
 <li>dvt75836 - Compilation of VHDL source code would generate temporary data in a flat library causing it to grow without bound.
The temporary data is now cleaned up at the end of every compile.</li>
 <li>dvt71451 - Predefined attribute A'ELEMENT could not have as its prefix a function call.  The LRM is not clear on this since A must be either an array type name or appropriate for an array object, and a function call is neither.  But because other attributes like A'RANGE where A is a function call are handled as legal, the A'ELEMENT attribute now also allows this.  Further, as a non-compliant extension of the language O'SUBTYPE may also have O be a function call.</li>
 <li>dvt74123 - In a subprogram appearing in a protected type body, another subprogram call with a named association element for a formal having the same name as a data member of the protected type would cause a compiler error.  This is now fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt73707 - Individual association involving a multidimensional array type formal whose index subtypes are enumeration types would not compile.  This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt74843 - The compiler would hang if it encountered a VHDL error involving a type declaration of an array type whose element subtype is an incomplete type of the same name as the array type itself.</li>

 <li>dvt70597 - (source, results) Multiple issues and crashes with $display/$sformatf/$error/$warning were fixed. A new switch -svext=[+|-]expdfmt has been added. This is off by default. When turned on, it leads to the following: 
<br>
1) Format specifiers in string variables, passed to $display will be interpreted as format specifiers and not normal strings. For example for the following snippet:<br>
<br>
  string s1 = "%d";<br>
  initial<br>
       $display(s1, 40);<br>

The output would be :<br>
<br>
#40<br>
<br>
Instead of:<br>
<br>
#%d    40<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) For $sformatf, arguments outnumbering the number of format specifiers will be  appended to the return string<br>

For example, for the following function call:<br>

$sformatf("%d", 40,40);<br>

The return string will be:"40   40" instead of "40" as before.

 <li>dvt74716 - (results) <pre>
The assert scope requires some special case processing to compute "total coverage" for an assertion:
    If an assertion has both pass and fail counts
        It is 100% if pass count > 0 and fail count == 0
    else if it has only fail count:
        It is 100% if fail count == 0
    	 
The UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST element of the summary record represents this percentage.

The ranktest tool will use and report the 'UCDB_ASSERT_SUCCESS_INST' metric (when possible). If there is any assertion failure in any test, it is a bug/problem that must be addressed by the user.

Until ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will use the "%success metric" like the rest of our reporting tools.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. The "%success" metric will be reported in the "Assertions" column. 

After ranktest detects a test that has an assertion failure:
 1. Ranktest will ignore the "%success" metric in its calculations.
 2. The ranktest "total coverage" number will NOT agree with the "total coverage" number our reporting tools.
 3. A "-" will be reported in the "Assertions" column.
 4. A warning message similar to the following will be issued: 

** Warning: (vcover-17208) One or more tests contain "assertion failures".
Ranktest will not include "assertion successes" in its ranking metric
calculations (i.e. "assertion successes" will be weighted as 0).

As a consequence, the ranking total coverage metric may be different from the total coverage numbers of other Questa GUI and CLI tools. The reason for this alteration is that the "%success" metric is now exhibiting a NON-monotonically increasing behavior and can no longer be used in the ranktest "greedy" algorithm. Ranktest will NOT use the "assertion pass" metric in any way (neither with nor without assertion failures). </li>

Syntax:<br /> checkpoint [-dir] &lt;pathname&gt;<br /> 
The following are the two valid scenarios for specifying a directory as the &lt;pathname&gt;. In both these cases a checkpoint file named 'vsim.cpt' is created in the specified directory. <br />
<ul>
<li> - The "-dir" option is specified with the &lt;pathname&gt;. If the directory doesn't exist then a new one is created.</li>

 <li>dvt65076 - <pre>
Introducing CLI and prgama based exclusion for same state transitions.
To exclude same state transition of s1 and s2 i.e. s1->s1 and s2->s2
Pragma=> // coverage fsm_off -fsamestate cst s1 s2
CLI => coverage exclude -du top -fsamestate cst s1 s2
To exclude all same state transition:
Pragma=>  // coverage fsm_off -fsamestate cst
CLI => coverage exclude -du top -fsamestate cst</li>
 <li>dvt75139 - (results) Covered bins, missing bins, total bins, and "% Hit" are added in covergroup text report for covergroup TYPEs and covergroup instances. Those are also added for TYPE coverpoints and crosses in covergroups having merge_instances=0. The "% Hit" number is also added for all coverpoints and crosses.</li>

<p /><a name="vmenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt70813 - Previously, whenever you generate HTML report from a UCDB. There will be page for each test run included in the UCDB. As we are trying to reduce the size of the default report as much as we can, All these pages will be suppressed. To generate these pages, you need to use the switch -testlist</li>
 <li>dvt70815 - Previously, excluded information included by default in the HTML report. Now, we have decided to suppress all excluded information by default, and we have introduced a new switch -showexcluded to include excluded information in the report.</li>
 <li>dvt71046 - We have introduced a new switch that can be used while generating the HTML report, it is "-du <du name>". This switch enables the user to; Suppress all DUs information except the specified DU. Notice that this switch will not suppress any other information other than DUs information. In other words, all instances and all testplan sections will be reported normally.</li>
 <li>dvt71432 - In the HTML report, we have introduced a new swtich; "-noinstance". This switch will suppress all instances from appearing in the HTML report.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Previously, there was a switch in the HTML report command called "-duonly". Using this switch, the report will include DUs information and suppress anything else. Now this switch is deprecated. From now on, when using this switch, the switch will be ignored with a warning message, but the report be generated normally (without suppressing any thing). Notice that the user can obtain the same effect of "-duonly" but when using another group of switches, those are; "-noinstance" and "-notestplan". Using those two switches together has the same of effect of the old switch "-duonly".</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) We have a switch in the HTML report generation command called "-instance <inst path>". Previously, using this switch will suppress all information form the HTML report except information related to the specified instance. In 10.4 we have changed the behavior of this switch. Now, this switch will suppress information related to all instances except the specified instance, but other information related to DUs and the testplan will be generated normally. Notice that the user can still have the same effect of the old "-instance <inst path>" but when using additional two switches; "-nodu" and "-notestplan".</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - VRM now automatically waits for UCDB file to appear after Action completion when run on slow file system.</li>
 <li>dvt73167 - The "-nosummary" option for vrun (VRM) now suppresses the summary at the end of a regression run.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Added GetNextToken utility procedure to VRM. This procedure takes a list of tokens from an RMDB parameter and returns tokens from the list one at a time in round-robin sequence.</li>

<p /><a name="paenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>Power Aware Enhancements in 10.4a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt73308 - Explicit usage of instance name in create_power_domain -elements will be given precedence over extents added because of wildcard expansion.
<br/>
Example:
<br/>
create_power_domain pd1 -elements {top*}
<br/>
create_power_domain pd2 -elements {top2}
<br/>

Here top1 will be extent of pd1, whereas top2 will be extent of pd2.</li>
 <li>dvt73426 - Command getenv can be used as a tcl command inside a UPF file to get the value of any environment variable.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Added a vopt switch "-pa_staticchecksonly" to do only power aware static checking (no simulation) of the design.All other PA processing will not be done and hence it will give fast turnaround time for static checks.The earlier option '-pa_checks=s' still exists to run PA simulation along with static checks.<br>

This new switch can also be used in conjunction with -pa_checks=s to limit the type of static checks.<br>
e.g<br>
    -pa_staticchecksonly -pa_checks=si would enable only isolation static checking.<br>
    -pa_staticchecksonly -pa_checks=sl would enable only level shifter static checking.<br>
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Added support of UPF created logic ports in set_isolation command under vopt option '-pa_enable=logicportiso'.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Added the vopt option '-pa_enable=alwaysonbuf' to turn off corruption of buf primitives.</li>
</ul>
