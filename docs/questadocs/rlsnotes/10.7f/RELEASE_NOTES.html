<ul><li>QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will become an error in later releases.
The reason for this change is to remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining a two-step flow.</li>
 <li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li><p>
This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

</p><p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

</p><p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

</p><p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
</p><ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 </li><li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 </li><li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 </li><li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
</li></ul></li>
 <li> The 10.7g update release will be the last release in the 10.7 series.</li>

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
</p><p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
</p><p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP &amp; Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 in the future.
</p><p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 &amp; 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-55788 - (results)  Module instances under for-generate blocks are not initialized with same initialization seed, which can result in non-LRM compliant simulation behavior. A SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;genmodseedfix&quot; has been implemented to address this issue. To enable LRM-compliant seeding of module instances under for-generate blocks, add &quot;-svrandext=+genmodseedfix&quot; to the vsim command line. This extension is disabled by default.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59880 - (results)  In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate a 'soft' constraint containing an indexed expression with a random index. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59050 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving constraints with function calls (having one or more arguments) would be incorrectly evaluated (sometimes resulting in spurious constraint contradiction failures). This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58384 - (results)  Significantly improved performance and reduced memory usage related to evaluation of randomize() calls involving large numbers of 'inside' constraint expressions.</li>
 <li>QSIM-61434 - (results)  In some rare cases, a call to randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario that had valid solution(s). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60784 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario with valid solution(s) involving constraints with random index expressions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60944 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario having valid solution(s) involving 'dist' constraints where the bit-width of the LHS is less than the bit-width of the RHS. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62161 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate a constraint involving a dist/inside/unique construct with an indexed multi-dimensional array (where the index is random) on the RHS. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60546 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Process names now reflect the value of their initial seed -- this method of identifying processes has been found to be more random-stable than the previous method (which displayed process names the same way as the GUI). Use &quot;-rngtraceopt=guiprocessnames&quot; to instruct RNG Trace to generate process names the old way.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-61128 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Implemented automatic filtering of &quot;noisy&quot; RNG trace output preceding set_randstate() operations. <br /><br />Output being written to a RNG trace file is buffered. When a set_randstate operation (on the executing process) is encountered, a backward scan of the buffered operation is made - looking for the first operation where the input (prior) randstate matches the randstate of the set_randstate operation. If such a operation is found, the matching operation along with the reset operation and intervening operations are filtered (removed from the buffer). Only RNG operations executed from the active process are considered. <br /><p>When the RNG trace is being written to the transcript (rather than to a file), the buffering/filtering will not be performed. This is because the filtering would delay the reporting of RNG operation (within the transcript) and make the reporting confusing.</p><p>The length of the buffer can be controlled by the &quot;-rngtracebuffersize &lt;size&gt;&quot; command line option. Setting a size less than 2 disables the filtering. The default is 20.<br /><br /></p></li>
 <li>QSIM-60157 - (results) Improved the output of the constraint contradiction report generated when randomize() fails and -solvefaildebug is enabled. The output of the &quot;Where&quot; section (which describes variables and expressions that are assigned to a constant value) is now annotated with a comment indicating if a variable is considered &quot;random&quot; or &quot;non-random&quot; at the time randomize() is invoked. This information can be useful when debugging unexpected randomize() failures due to testbench errors related to missing 'rand' keywords on class fields that should be declared random.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60165 - (results) The output of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report has been improved when outputting information about variables/constraints involving packed structs. In the past, individual fields of packed structs were displayed as part-selects by the constraint contradiction report. The report now displays these as field names (where possible) improving the readability of the report.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode parameters in the above cases.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56234 - (results)  In certain cases, association of array subelements in ports was leading to incorrect results. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58539 - (results)  The attributes <b>INSTANCE_NAME</b> and<b> PATH_NAME</b>, were not considered globally static.  If the prefix of the attribute is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or concurrent statement.  This currently results in extra statement executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different from previous versions. </li>
 <li>QSIM-57969 - (results)  Using a function call without arguments in a generic map was showing syntax error incorrectly. This has been fixed. <div><br /></div></li>

 <li>[nodvtid]  -  SystemVerilog macros undefining and subsequently redefining a macro of the same name repeatedly during macro expansion would generate incorrect results.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55788 - (results)  Module instances under for-generate blocks are not initialized with same initialization seed, which can result in non-LRM compliant simulation behavior. A SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;genmodseedfix&quot; has been implemented to address this issue.

 <li>QSIM-60156 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would return 0 indicating no solutions for constraints involving signed modulo expressions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59957 -  In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving an array.sum() constraint with a 'with' clause within the context of an iterative constraint would trigger an internal error. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59880 - (results)  In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate a 'soft' constraint containing an indexed expression with a random index. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59116 -  Significantly improved performance of randomize() calls involving large numbers of 'randc' variables.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59051 - In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving constraints with function calls (having one or more arguments) would trigger an internal error. This issue has been resolved.<br /><br /></li>

 <li>QSIM-58871 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause the simulator to crash when evaluating constraints involving a non-random multi-dimensional packed array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58384 - (results)  Significantly improved performance and reduced memory usage related to evaluation of randomize() calls involving large numbers of 'inside' constraint expressions.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58334 - Attempting to randomize() a protected (encrypted) class containing a static random variable would cause a crash or trigger an error (vsim-7180). This issue has been resolved, and randomize() calls on protected classes w/ static random variables are now supported.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59820 - In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving constraints having function calls will spuriously fail with the error: &quot;(vsim-7090) Invalid X or Z in a state expression value within a constraint.&quot; This issue has been fixed. </li>
 <li>QSIM-60117 -  In some rare cases, randomize() calls referring to one or more 'soft dist' constraints would cause a spurious failure (no solutions). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-61434 - (results)  In some rare cases, a call to randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario that had valid solution(s). This issue has been fixed.</li>

 <li>QSIM-61459 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger an internal error for scenarios involving constraints with function call expressions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57529 - Compiling a constraint involving a non-random real-type expression that is cast to an integral type would trigger spurious warning messages about possibly requiring the 'svrnm' (SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling) license during simulation. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-61486 - Constraints involving array.sum() reduction expressions for multi-dimensional arrays would trigger an internal error during randomize() when &quot;-svext=ared&quot; was enabled. This issue has been fixed.<br /></li>

 <li>QSIM-57546 -  If a package contains a package instance within a USE clause, static array constraints within the package instance may not be compiled correctly, possible causing a fatal internal error during elaboration of  the design by the simulator.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57795 - The compiler could report a fatal internal error if it encountered a generic declaration list with an index constraint within a generic vector preceding an interface package.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58539 - (results)  The attributes <b>INSTANCE_NAME</b> and<b> PATH_NAME</b>, were not considered globally static.  If the prefix of the attribute is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or concurrent statement.

 <li>QSIM-57969 - (results)  Using a function call without arguments in a generic map was showing syntax error incorrectly. This has been fixed. <div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-60023 - Use of the -mixedsvvh switch could result in the compiler erroneously emitting error vcom-1995, which states that a package cannot be imported into SystemVerilog designs. This can occur when at least two VHDL packages are compiled on a single command-line with the -mixedsvvh switch; and, one package contains a constant declaration initialized by a function defined in the other package, and the name of the first package comes lexically before the name of the second package.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57712 -  If an entity has a  generic whose type depends on a previously declared generic and that entity is directly instantiated, then vsim could crash when loading the design. The work around was to use a component instantiation. </li>
 <li>QSIM-60125 - Simulations can crash, producing a stacktrace, when simulating a VHDL design that calls procedures defined inside an uninstantiated package with signal-valued attribute expressions, using the 'TRANSACTION, 'STABLE, and 'QUIET attributes.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56236 -  Several related problems are fixed<br /><ol><li>Ports that are of a multi-dimensional array type and the index constraints depend on generics would crash.</li><li>Partially constrained ports that are arrays of arrays would crash</li><li>Generic of type array whose constraints depend on other generics would crash.</li></ol>All these issues have been resolved. </li>
 <li>QSIM-59785 - The compiler could generate incorrect code for the mapping of a signal to a component port when the port is an array of records containing unconstrained array fields, and the component instantiation is within a generate block. Incorrect code generation could result in invalid error messages emitted from the compiler, the optimizer, or simulator, or could cause the simulator to crash.</li>

<p /><a name="systemverilogenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7f</b></font>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - SystemVerilog macro names defined on the command line may contain the minus ('-') character in addition to the set of characters that form valid identifiers. Enable this extension with the &quot;-svext=+mncim&quot; option.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58007 - When -solveverbose or -solveinfo is specified on the vsim command line, the solver will dump information about the constraints which participate in a given randomize() call. In some cases, constraints which contain references to non-random variables would display the names of the variables and not the value of those variables, making it difficult to debug issues related to those constraints. The -solveverbose/-solveinfo output for these kinds of constraints has been improved -- now the value of non-random variables and the names of those variables (as an in-line comment) are displayed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58407 - Implemented a new feature &quot;RNG Trace&quot; that produces diagnostic output during simulation to assist in the analysis of random-stability issues between two differing simulations. Enable RNG tracing by adding &quot;-rngtrace&quot; to the vsim command line. For additional details and options, refer to the Questa SIM Command Reference Manual (options &quot;-rngtrace&quot;, &quot;-rngtraceopt&quot;, &quot;-rngtraceclassfilter&quot;, &quot;-rngtraceprocessfilter&quot;) and the &quot;Simulator State Variables&quot; Section of the Questa SIM User's Manual (variables &quot;RNGTrace&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceFile&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceOpt&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceClassFilter&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceProcessFilter&quot;)</li>
 <li>QSIM-59275 - Given a randomize() scenario with no solutions, when -solvefaildebug is enabled, a constraint contradiction report is generated representing the minimum-set of contradictory constraints. If a timeout occurred during the determination of the minimum-set, the error message &quot;(vsim-7175) randomize() failed due to a non-reproducible constraint conflict.&quot; was displayed. This error message was found to be confusing and has been improved. The new error message that is displayed when a timeout occurs during -solvefaildebug minimum-set generation is: &quot;(vsim-7097) Timeout while testing for -solvefaildebug constraint conflicts (SolveFailDebugTimeout=50).&quot;<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-59852 - Given
a randomize() scenario with no solutions, when -solvefaildebug is enabled, a
constraint contradiction report is generated representing the minimum-set of
contradictory constraints. If a timeout occurred during the determination of
the minimum-set, an error message was displayed and no constraint contradiction report (or testcase when -solvefailtestcase is specified) would be generated. This behavior has changed -- if a timeout now occurs during -solvefaildebug minimum-set generation, then a partial constraint contradiction report (and partial testcase) will be generated. The partial results may provide enough information to assist in debugging the constraint contradiction.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-60546 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Process names now reflect the value of their initial seed -- this method of identifying processes has been found to be more random-stable than the previous method (which displayed process names the same way as the GUI). Use &quot;-rngtraceopt=guiprocessnames&quot; to instruct RNG Trace to generate process names the old way.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-61128 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Implemented automatic filtering of &quot;noisy&quot; RNG trace output preceding set_randstate() operations. <br /><br />Output being written to a RNG trace file is buffered. When a set_randstate operation (on the executing process) is encountered, a backward scan of the buffered operation is made - looking for the first operation where the input (prior) randstate matches the randstate of the set_randstate operation. If such a operation is found, the matching operation along with the reset operation and intervening operations are filtered (removed from the buffer). Only RNG operations executed from the active process are considered. <br /><p>When the RNG trace is being written to the transcript (rather than to a file), the buffering/filtering will not be performed. This is because the filtering would delay the reporting of RNG operation (within the transcript) and make the reporting confusing.</p><p>The length of the buffer can be controlled by the &quot;-rngtracebuffersize &lt;size&gt;&quot; command line option. Setting a size less than 2 disables the filtering. The default is 20.<br /><br /></p></li>
 <li>QSIM-60157 - (results) Improved the output of the constraint contradiction report generated when randomize() fails and -solvefaildebug is enabled. The output of the &quot;Where&quot; section (which describes variables and expressions that are assigned to a constant value) is now annotated with a comment indicating if a variable is considered &quot;random&quot; or &quot;non-random&quot; at the time randomize() is invoked. This information can be useful when debugging unexpected randomize() failures due to testbench errors related to missing 'rand' keywords on class fields that should be declared random.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62297 - In the past, randomize() calls involving a constraint having a function call with a non-random unpacked array argument would elicit an error at compile time. The restriction on unpacked arrays as arguments to a function calls in a constraints has been eased -- these constructs are now allowed and evaluated.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-60165 - (results) The output of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report has been improved when outputting information about variables/constraints involving packed structs. In the past, individual fields of packed structs were displayed as part-selects by the constraint contradiction report. The report now displays these as field names (where possible) improving the readability of the report.</li>
