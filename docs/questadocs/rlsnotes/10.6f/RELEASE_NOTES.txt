   Key Information
     * The vlog -wireasinterconnect option is deprecated due to
       performance issues, and a warning message is issued to that effect
       when used. The vopt -rnmautointeconnect option is preferred because
       it takes advantage of the vopt analysis to more selectively convert
       wires to interconnect. Only wires connected upwards from
       real/wreal/nettype/interconnect ports are converted.
     * The 10.6g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.6
       series.

   Release Announcements in 10.6f
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5
            x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release,
            gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for
            SystemC have been discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
            limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
          + Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
            plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
            documentation are fully functional.
            Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
            result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
            current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF
            manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web
            browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this
            behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is
            compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
            page-oriented layout.
            Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between
            topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference
            material, and other related technical content.

          + (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
            deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
            deprecation process:
               o The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a
                 deprecation suppressible error message.
               o In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will
                 not be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with
                 error message.
               o Customer scripts using this switch will have to be
                 changed. This legacy switch forces incremental mode
                 (pre-6.0 behavior) which is sub-optimal, and it is no
                 longer maintained.
               o We regularly review our OS/Platform support for
                 Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification
                 products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
                 That process normally takes a number of years from
                 decision to action. Customer notifications are typically
                 only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and
                 Install Guide.
                 We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year
                 from now. We began notifications of this change back in
                 January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
                 As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are
                 discontinued, replacement hardware can only support
                 Windows 10. So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP
                 & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity and ability to
                 support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
                 Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to
                 discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only
                 Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10. However
                 we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6
                 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL
                 - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
                 Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6f
       User Interface Compatibility

     * QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the
       Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some
       customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag.
       Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag
       now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.
     * QSIM-54037 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2().
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving "unique"
       constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions)
       for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios
       involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no
       solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55627 - (results) In some rare cases involving equality
       constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini
       files and deprecated warning message.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents
       of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not
       included. Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are
       also excluded. Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed"
       are filtered out of logging.
     * QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is
       connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output
       was incorrect. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-50634 - (results) In certain cases, optimization of clocked
       processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55137 - (results) In certain cases, vopt was crashing during
       optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
       ___________________________________________________________________

       General Defects Repaired in 10.6f

     * QSIM-24925 - Input-to-Input SDF INTERCONNECT delays are not
       annotated in optimized vsim run when there is not any driver on the
       high connection net.
     * QSIM-52009 - Fixed an issue where tool was crashing while printing
       capstats report with -du option. The issue was related to variable
       declarations inside fork..join.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6f
     * QSIM-21724 - The logging of nets or registers of types containing
       SV unions has several issues which would lead to crashes or the
       display of incorrect data. These issues have been resolved.
     * QSIM-53662 - For certain signal widths the column width was being
       miscalculated which resulted in '*' being displayed in place of an
       actual value. The correct width is now being calculated.
     * QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the
       Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some
       customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag.
       Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag
       now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6f
     * QSIM-50272 - The vencrypt feature "-auto3protect" could not
       properly handle macro call syntax in the port list of a module.
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.
     * QSIM-51616 - Intertial delay was not working properly for
       tranif/rtranif primitives with delay when the control/enable input
       had multiple transitions within the delay period.
     * QSIM-52696 - In some cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating
       an array.size() constraint for a random dynamic array of real type.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-53856 - Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real'
       type on the RHS (e.g. "myvar inside { array_of_real }") would
       trigger an internal error "==? operator invalid for REAL". This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54037 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2().
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving "unique"
       constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions)
       for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios
       involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no
       solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55627 - (results) In some rare cases involving equality
       constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This
       issue has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6f
     * QSIM-5497 - For some specific cases of type conversions used in the
       unbound components, vsim used to crash. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-10698 - The verilog reserved word "global" was not supported
       in VHDL packages with -mixedsvvh switch. This has been supported
       now.
     * VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents
       of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not
       included. Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are
       also excluded. Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed"
       are filtered out of logging.
     * QSIM-43580 - A port association that is an aggregate with an OTHERS
       choice, for a constrained port that is an array-of-array, and where
       those constraints are globally static, could result in either a
       compiler internal error or a run-time simulator error about
       mismatched array lengths.
     * QSIM-26474 - In certain specific cases usage of slice expressions
       inside loop statements used to result in a crash. This has been
       fixed.
     * QSIM-32597 - In certain specific cases usage of nested if
       statements resulted in a crash due to certain optimizations. This
       has been fixed.
     * QSIM-50516 - In some case vopt generate an internal error or bad
       code for a configuration. This would occur if a generic or port of
       a component being configuration was used anywhere other than the
       port/generic map.
     * QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is
       connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output
       was incorrect. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-3588 - For some specific cases of for generates, vsim use to
       crash. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-53077 - In a protected type body, if there was a data member
       whose subtype involved another data member's value, then bad code,
       which would crash the simulator, would result.
     * QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a
       locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect
       simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.
     * QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or
       default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved
       word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the
       simulator. This is a syntax error that is now detected.
     * QSIM-54941 - The presence of a package instantiation declaration
       within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the
       compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone
       design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line
       switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map
       clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in
       scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts
       that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.
     * QSIM-50634 - (results) In certain cases, optimization of clocked
       processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55137 - (results) In certain cases, vopt was crashing during
       optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed.

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.6f
     * QSIM-51654 - scparse compilation failures with the nlohmann JSON
       c++ code has been fixed
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.6f
     * QSIM-53578 - When a write-protected library contained a Verilog DU
       made visible (as its equivalent ENTITY) by VHDL "use lib.all" in a
       VHDL design unit, if the VHDL design unit then contained an
       identifier that was the same as the name of this Verilog module, an
       error would occur as the equivalent ENTITY was being made. This
       error happened on Windows platforms only.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.6f
     * VM-8513 - Fixed bug where "-exitcode" command-line option was not
       producing a non-zero exit code if the regression run had tests
       which timed out. The fix also includes producing a non-zero exit
       code in the event a test is killed (by the user) or dropped
       (possibly due to a VRM bug).
     * VM-10665 - Fixed bug where a runnable whose base attribute
       contained multiple runnable names separated by commas would result
       in an error when run through the RMDB sanity checker ("-checkrmdb"
       command-line option).

   General Enhancements in 10.6f
     * QSIM-879 - Added support for matching bit-blasted scalar port in
       rtl with normal non-escaped port names in SDF under switch
       "-sdfallowvlogescapeport".

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.6f
     * QSIM-35477 - The SourceDir variable has improved the remapping
       behavior for finding source files. Instead of having to define each
       source directory location, defining a single root source directory
       should be sufficient to find any source file within the directory
       sub-tree, as long as the sub-tree path is the same as the original.

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6f
     * QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini
       files and deprecated warning message.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Enhancements in 10.6f
     * QSIM-43418 - Designs that have a very large number of signals that
       are either multidimensional arrays or arrays whose elements are
       arrays or records will now load faster at simulation time.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Enhancements in 10.6f
     * QSIM-53671 - VHDL can now instantiate a Verilog module that has a
       multi-dimensional packed array-of-array-of-reg array port, when the
       actual connected to that port is a VHDL array port (as long as the
       number of scalar subelements matches).

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.6f
     * VM-7029 - VRM testlist improvements:
          + If the first token on a non-comment testlist line is "include"
            and is followed by a second non-integer token, the second
            token is treated as a path name (absolute or relative to the
            directory where the parent file is located) and the referenced
            file is opened and recursively parsed as a nested testlist.
          + If the first (test name) token on two or more lines in a
            testlist are identical, the tests generated by those lines are
            combined into a single repeat list under that test name.
