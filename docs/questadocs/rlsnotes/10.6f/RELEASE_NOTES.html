<ul><li>The vlog -wireasinterconnect option is deprecated due to performance issues, and a warning message is issued to that effect when used. The vopt -rnmautointeconnect option is preferred because it takes advantage of the vopt analysis to more selectively convert wires to interconnect. Only wires connected upwards from real/wreal/nettype/interconnect ports are converted.</li>
 <li> The 10.6g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.6 series. </li>

There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>
For information about Adobe's discontinued support of Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on SupportNet.<br><br>
Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>(source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be deprecated in the next major 
release 10.7 following normal deprecation process:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
suppressible error message.
<li>In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not be 
accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error message.
<li>Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed. 
This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior) which 
is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

 <li>QSIM-53662 - For certain signal widths the column width was being miscalculated which resulted in '*' being displayed in place of an actual value. The correct width is now being calculated.</li>

 <li>QSIM-52696 - In some cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating an array.size() constraint for a random dynamic array of real type. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>QSIM-53856 -  Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real' type on the RHS (e.g. &quot;myvar inside { array_of_real }&quot;) would trigger an internal error &quot;==? operator invalid for REAL&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>

<ul><li>QSIM-5497 - For some specific cases of type conversions used in the unbound components, vsim used to crash. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-10698 - The verilog reserved word "global" was not supported in VHDL packages with -mixedsvvh switch. This has been supported now.</li>
 <li>VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not included.  Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are also excluded.  Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed" are filtered out of logging.

</li>
 <li>QSIM-43580 - A port association that is an aggregate with an OTHERS choice, for a constrained port that is an array-of-array, and where those constraints are globally static, could result in either a compiler internal error or a run-time simulator error about mismatched array lengths.</li>
 <li>QSIM-26474 - In certain specific cases usage of slice expressions inside loop statements used to result in a crash. This has been fixed. </li>
 <li>QSIM-32597 - In certain specific cases usage of nested if statements resulted in a crash due to certain optimizations. This has been fixed.</li>

 <li>QSIM-53077 - In a protected type body, if there was a data member whose subtype involved another data member's value, then bad code, which would crash the simulator, would result.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the simulator.  This is a syntax error that is now detected.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54941 -  The presence of a package instantiation declaration within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.</li>
