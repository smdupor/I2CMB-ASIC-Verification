[10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been discontinued.<br>
[10.4] Licensing Information
<p>There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.

<p>However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and older,
please note the following:

<ul><li>Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The 
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will 
be FLEXnet version 11.11.1.1.
<li>For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
<li>If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
</ul><br>
[10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.<br>
[10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology) library, sources and documentation have been updated to version 2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.<br>
[10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.<br>
[10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.1] Support for GCC versions gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.<br>
<br>
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.4c.</li>

<p /><a name="compatibility"></a><font size="4"><b>Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4c</b></font>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt68429 - (results) Added the support for alias of a wreal net.</li>
 <li>dvt77905 - (results) vopt didn't properly handle wildcard ports (".*") in bind instances when -pduspec or -tbxhierrefs was specified.</li>
 <li>dvt78472 - (results) Fixed a bug related to class specializations created in extern functions of a class. Before the fix , this bug was leading to creation of multiple specializations of a class for equivalent set of parameters.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) VPI access to class objects (vpiClassObj) is in the process of being improved. Users may see some changes, for example the name of vpiClassObj objects is now tied to the object ID, not the class variable from which the object was originally obtained. Class variables and class objects are distinct VPI objects and are not expected to have the same name. Class object handles are now shared, and become invalid when the kernel releases the item due to garbage collection. This is LRM behavior.</li>
 <li>dvt78126 - (results) An LRM extension has been added to allow the use of array reduction methods on multi-dimensional unpacked arrays, without the need of using a 'with' clause.  
To use this, specify "-svext=ared" (for array reduction) on the vlog command-line.  In that case, a
multi-dimensional unpacked array will be treated as if it had a single
dimension [0:total_number_of_elements-1].  
</li>
 <li>dvt71352 - (results) Support of pulse Error/Reject behavior on INTERCONNECT delays on optimized cell inputs. Earlier error 12031 was reported for such cases.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) In VRM, the "testname" parameter is recognized for group Runnables. That means a mergeScript or triageScript Action now inherits the testname under which it runs and the preScript and postScript of a group Runnable which defines a non-blank "testname" parameter are considered part of the same test. The "testname" parameter should only be defined in task Runnables if the intention is to flag only the leaf-level execScript Actions as tests.</li>
 <li>dvt77656 - (results) Formal items linked with testplans by rules are now displayed in Tracker window like regular objects using their own icon.</li>
 <li>dvt78842 - (results) The tplanref and tplansection attribute names are now supported for tests to link with specified testplan sections. The tplanref attribute is for specifying target testplan section's reference number, and the tplansection attribute is for specifying the full hierarchical path of the target testplan section.</li>
 <li>dvt78894 - (results) The tplansection is now supported as an attribute name in HDL source code for specifying testplan scope hierarchy paths to link with. It also works when used within option.comment and type_option.comment of covergroups, coverpoints, and crosses.</li>

<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="generaldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>General Defects Repaired in 10.4c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt78556 - When the path to the tmp directory (e.g. /tmp on linux) is redirected to a path that contains spaces, various errors can occur that are not obviously related to the tmp directory.  The tmp directory is more commonly redirected on the Windows platform. </li>
 <li>dvt78714 - The vsim option -noautooldlibpath is ignored when used with -batch.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt67302 - The "edit" command and other uses of the PrefMain(Editor) setting failed to correctly invoke the user specified editor application whenever the application pathname contains spaces.  </li>
 <li>dvt63029 - Under rare circumstances, single stepping a simulation will hang the simulator requiring the user to 'kill' the simulation in order to gain control.
This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt78368 - Use of -g <param=value> command-line option reports a GUI startup error.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt78370 - Windows only: On invoking "questasim.exe -do file.do", the "-do" option is ignored resulting in the file being opened in the source window.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt69368 - If a process is labeled with the same name as it's inclosing architecture, a breakpoint within the process will not display the location correctly when the simulation stops.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt34881 - The list of recent Directories and recent Projects under the File menu can now be adjusted to list as many locations as the user wants.  Two new preference settings have been added:  PrefMain(recentDirectoryLimit) and PrefMain(recentProjectLimit).  The default is no 8 entries for each list.

The pull down menu entries will also display the full path when hovering over the particular item.  This will make identifying long path names easier.
</li>
 <li>dvt68664 - Export Image for the Wave window would hang the user interface and the desktop.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt67339 - Protected design units would not be displayed in the Library window of the GUI, even though they are listed when using the "vdir" command.</li>
 <li>dvt79321 - When using -batch mode, continuation lines in a "do" file are not interpreted correctly.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt77355 - When the GUI opens with a small initial window size, the application will hang until the window size is made larger.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

<p /><a name="verilogdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt77618 - Under some circumstances, use of 'bind' with an interface when using +floatparameters could result in a crash on a statement using a virtual interface that points to the bind target.</li>
 <li>dvt68429 - (results) Added the support for alias of a wreal net.</li>
 <li>dvt77905 - (results) vopt didn't properly handle wildcard ports (".*") in bind instances when -pduspec or -tbxhierrefs was specified.</li>
 <li>dvt78506 - When instantiating a Verilog module from VHDL, passing an empty string to a parameter could result in memory corruption.</li>
 <li>dvt78472 - (results) Fixed a bug related to class specializations created in extern functions of a class. Before the fix , this bug was leading to creation of multiple specializations of a class for equivalent set of parameters.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - In some cases redefined macros were not overwriting previous macro definitions.</li>
 <li>dvt77832 - vencrypt would generate syntax errors when the last token in a file was a name from a `(tick) name.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) VPI access to class objects (vpiClassObj) is in the process of being improved. Users may see some changes, for example the name of vpiClassObj objects is now tied to the object ID, not the class variable from which the object was originally obtained. Class variables and class objects are distinct VPI objects and are not expected to have the same name. Class object handles are now shared, and become invalid when the kernel releases the item due to garbage collection. This is LRM behavior.</li>
 <li>dvt78513 - Fixed a bug in parsing of modport expression.</li>
 <li>dvt78508 - Change a Time value error into a new warning if time value can not be stored in 32 bits. Rightmost digits greater than 32 bit number will be truncated. For example 52111111561111ns will be truncated to 52111111500000ns.</li>
 <li>dvt78334 - Fixed a bug when we have multiple packages with same name in different libraries.</li>
 <li>dvt78035 - Fixed a vopt crash in a scenario when interface parameter is initialized through hier-ref and hier-ref is a structure field.
Example :-
interface isi_bus_if #(isi_bus_pkg::bus_param_t BUS_PARAM = isi_bus_pkg::bus_param_defaults) ();
  localparam ADDR_WIDTH = BUS_PARAM.ADDR_WIDTH;
endinterface
</li>
 <li>dvt76678 - Fixed a bug where we were not giving error when we were assigning nested virtual interface to an interface with different parameters.</li>
 <li>dvt77732 - Fixed a vsim package import export error when some files are compiled with -timescale option with vlog and other files are not compiled with -timescale. This has been fixed now.</li>
 <li>dvt77232 - Fixed a bug for bind instances, which resulted in simulation getting hanged. </li>

<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt76976 - Use of access types that references a formal generic type would function inconsistently if the actual type is a record type.</li>
 <li>dvt73987 - In Some particular cases, compilation time on windows had increased. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt72396 - In Some specific cases, an optimization used to give incorrect results. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt79007 - A package-declared signal used as an element of an array begin associated via individual association with a class signal procedure formal, where the procedure is declared in a place that is not the package, could cause a crash.</li>
 <li>dvt79195 - Type conversion from a floating point value to an integer value of type INTEGER would incorrectly report an error if the value was the legal value of -2147483648; likewise for 2147483647.</li>
 <li>dvt79119 - The "change" command would work if attempted on an access object or member of such.</li>
 <li>dvt77970 - For some specific cases of aggregate expression, evaluation of expressions use to give incorrect error. This has been fixed.</li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - Fixed bug in VRM (GUI only) where built-in parameters could be expanded incorrectly under certain conditions.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Fixed a bug in VRM pro-active grid checker where Actions clubbed into a single grid job were checked as though they were separate jobs, resulting in bogus errors.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Fixed two bugs in VRM's handling of array jobs for UGE grids.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Fixed bug in VRM GUI such that mergeScript and triageScript Actions will now appear in the VRM Results Window in a more logical sequence with respect to the other Actions in the group under which they were executed.</li>

<p /><a name="powerawaredefects"></a><font size="4"><b>Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.4c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt78410 - During static analysis of power states and PSTs, the tool used to give pessimistic results when dont-cares are used in a case where a specific combination of supply values are assumed after expanding the dont-cares. This combination is not defined in other PSTs sharing the same supplies and hence should be ignored during expansion. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt77969 - The vopt used to crash when a specific style of expression was used in add_power_state command. This expression results in a cyclic dependency of UPF objects referred in it. This has been fixed.</li>

<p /><a name="uienhancements"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Enhancements in 10.4c</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt27751 - Support two new variations for the "bp" command.  Allows specifying the line-number only in the command.  The command will use the source file of the current context.  For example:<br>
<pre>
    bp 57
</pre>

The "bp" command will also accept the common gdb syntax of "file-name<b>:</b>line-number", for example:<br>
<pre>
    bp dut.sv:57
</pre>

Here is the full usage description for the "bp" command:<br>
<pre>
# Usage:
# HDL breakpoints:
#  bp location [options] [{command ...}]
#    location: {[filename] line_number | filename:line_number | in task_or_fcn}
#    options: [-id id#] [-label label] [-disable] [-uvm] [[-inst region]...]
#             [-cond {condition_expression}] [-appendinst]
# 
# C breakpoints:
#  bp -c location [options]
#    location: {function_name | line_number | filename:line_number | *0xhex_address}
#    options: [-disable] [[-inst {systemc_module_instance_name}]...]
#             [-cond {condition_expression}] [-appendinst]
# 
# Information:
#   bp [-query filename [line_number [line_number]]]
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt30446 - Two enhancements have been added to the run & step commands, reporting of the simulation time and delta when the run operation completes, and reporting the run status when the run operation completes.  These reports are enabled by setting the preference variable PrefMain(noRunTimeMsg) and PrefMain(noRunStatusMsg) respectively to 0.  Here is an example of these reports:
<pre>

VSIM 1> run 105
VSIM 2> set PrefMain(noRunTimeMsg) 0
# 0
VSIM 3> run 112
# Time: @217 ns 0       
VSIM 4> set PrefMain(noRunStatusMsg) 0
# 0
VSIM 5> run 100
# Time: @317 ns 0       
# Status: ready end
VSIM 6> set PrefMain(noRunTimeMsg) 1
# 1
VSIM 7> run 50
# Status: ready end
VSIM 8> set PrefMain(noRunStatusMsg) 1
# 1
VSIM 9> run 55
VSIM 10> 
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt9844 - The "when" command has been enhanced to support repeating time breakpoints.  The -repeat switch works with "when" breakpoint expressions involving time ($now).  Normally expressions involving $now will only trigger once.  With the -repeat option the "when" breakpoint will reestablish the breakpoint when triggered so that it will fire again for the next time period.</li>

</li>
 <li>dvt71352 - (results) Support of pulse Error/Reject behavior on INTERCONNECT delays on optimized cell inputs. Earlier error 12031 was reported for such cases.</li>
 <li>dvt76748 - -gblso option has been enhanced to accept multiple shared objects. <br />   
-gblso &lt;shared_obj&gt;[,&lt;shared_obj&gt;...] <br />
When multiple shared objects are specified, they will first be merged internally and then loaded as single shared object.
</li>
 <li>dvt77101 - Warnings generated during the C/C++ source file compilation will be echoed to stdout by default. <br/>

Additionally, vlog and qverilog have a new option -ccwarn [on|off|verbose|strict]. <br/>
The -ccwarn option will control the GNU warning/error flags for the C/C++ files compilation. <br/>
                     Options are: <br/>
                        on (default): compiles with -Wreturn-type, -Wimplicit,<br/>

 <li>[nodvtid]  - By default, the GetNextIteration user-definable procedure in VRM will return compound tokens when foreach tokens include characters other than the leading asterisk (ie: test1-1, test1-2, etc when the foreach token is "*1"). This is to prevent the inadvertent generation of duplicate tokens.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) In VRM, the "testname" parameter is recognized for group Runnables. That means a mergeScript or triageScript Action now inherits the testname under which it runs and the preScript and postScript of a group Runnable which defines a non-blank "testname" parameter are considered part of the same test. The "testname" parameter should only be defined in task Runnables if the intention is to flag only the leaf-level execScript Actions as tests.</li>
 <li>dvt78588 - In VRM, when the "-noautomergedelete" command-line option is specified, the testplan, if any, is deleted from any merged UCDB files to which tests from that regression run are merged. A new "-notplandelete" command-line option prevents the testplan from being deleted. For now, the testplan deletion is ignored with a warning when the merged UCDB is a coverstore.
</li>
 <li>dvt76500 - VRM named queues maxrunning attribute is now considered a limit on the number of concurrently running jobs. Consequently, a multi-action fixed-list clubbed group, enabled by maxclubbing, is considered a single job; if maxrunning and maxclubbing are set to m and n respectively, then the named queue can be running a maximum of m jobs each containing n actions</li>
 <li>dvt76500 - VRM multi-action jobs, fixed-list (maxclubbing) and array jobs (maxarray), combine an unlimited number of actions when their controlling attributes are set to 0.</li>
 <li>dvt77656 - (results) Formal items linked with testplans by rules are now displayed in Tracker window like regular objects using their own icon.</li>
 <li>dvt78842 - (results) The tplanref and tplansection attribute names are now supported for tests to link with specified testplan sections. The tplanref attribute is for specifying target testplan section's reference number, and the tplansection attribute is for specifying the full hierarchical path of the target testplan section.</li>
 <li>dvt78894 - (results) The tplansection is now supported as an attribute name in HDL source code for specifying testplan scope hierarchy paths to link with. It also works when used within option.comment and type_option.comment of covergroups, coverpoints, and crosses.</li>
