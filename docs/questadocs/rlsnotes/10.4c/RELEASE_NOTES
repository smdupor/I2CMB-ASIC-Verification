   Release Announcements in 10.4c
     * [nodvtid] -
       [10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been
       discontinued.
       [10.4] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.
       However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs
       that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.4c.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4c

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt68429 - (results) Added the support for alias of a wreal net.
     * dvt77905 - (results) vopt didn't properly handle wildcard ports
       (".*") in bind instances when -pduspec or -tbxhierrefs was
       specified.
     * dvt78472 - (results) Fixed a bug related to class specializations
       created in extern functions of a class. Before the fix , this bug
       was leading to creation of multiple specializations of a class for
       equivalent set of parameters.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) VPI access to class objects (vpiClassObj) is
       in the process of being improved. Users may see some changes, for
       example the name of vpiClassObj objects is now tied to the object
       ID, not the class variable from which the object was originally
       obtained. Class variables and class objects are distinct VPI
       objects and are not expected to have the same name. Class object
       handles are now shared, and become invalid when the kernel releases
       the item due to garbage collection. This is LRM behavior.
     * dvt78126 - (results) An LRM extension has been added to allow the
       use of array reduction methods on multi-dimensional unpacked
       arrays, without the need of using a 'with' clause. To use this,
       specify "-svext=ared" (for array reduction) on the vlog
       command-line. In that case, a multi-dimensional unpacked array will
       be treated as if it had a single dimension
       [0:total_number_of_elements-1].
     * dvt71352 - (results) Support of pulse Error/Reject behavior on
       INTERCONNECT delays on optimized cell inputs. Earlier error 12031
       was reported for such cases.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In VRM, the "testname" parameter is recognized
       for group Runnables. That means a mergeScript or triageScript
       Action now inherits the testname under which it runs and the
       preScript and postScript of a group Runnable which defines a
       non-blank "testname" parameter are considered part of the same
       test. The "testname" parameter should only be defined in task
       Runnables if the intention is to flag only the leaf-level
       execScript Actions as tests.
     * dvt77656 - (results) Formal items linked with testplans by rules
       are now displayed in Tracker window like regular objects using
       their own icon.
     * dvt78842 - (results) The tplanref and tplansection attribute names
       are now supported for tests to link with specified testplan
       sections. The tplanref attribute is for specifying target testplan
       section's reference number, and the tplansection attribute is for
       specifying the full hierarchical path of the target testplan
       section.
     * dvt78894 - (results) The tplansection is now supported as an
       attribute name in HDL source code for specifying testplan scope
       hierarchy paths to link with. It also works when used within
       option.comment and type_option.comment of covergroups, coverpoints,
       and crosses.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) The inFactSv package has changed, so designs
       that use it must be recompiled in Questa 10.4c.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt78556 - When the path to the tmp directory (e.g. /tmp on linux)
       is redirected to a path that contains spaces, various errors can
       occur that are not obviously related to the tmp directory. The tmp
       directory is more commonly redirected on the Windows platform.
     * dvt78714 - The vsim option -noautooldlibpath is ignored when used
       with -batch. This issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt67302 - The "edit" command and other uses of the
       PrefMain(Editor) setting failed to correctly invoke the user
       specified editor application whenever the application pathname
       contains spaces.
     * dvt63029 - Under rare circumstances, single stepping a simulation
       will hang the simulator requiring the user to 'kill' the simulation
       in order to gain control. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt78368 - Use of -g command-line option reports a GUI startup
       error. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt78370 - Windows only: On invoking "questasim.exe -do file.do",
       the "-do" option is ignored resulting in the file being opened in
       the source window. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt69368 - If a process is labeled with the same name as it's
       inclosing architecture, a breakpoint within the process will not
       display the location correctly when the simulation stops. This
       issue has been resolved.
     * dvt34881 - The list of recent Directories and recent Projects under
       the File menu can now be adjusted to list as many locations as the
       user wants. Two new preference settings have been added:
       PrefMain(recentDirectoryLimit) and PrefMain(recentProjectLimit).
       The default is no 8 entries for each list. The pull down menu
       entries will also display the full path when hovering over the
       particular item. This will make identifying long path names easier.
     * dvt68664 - Export Image for the Wave window would hang the user
       interface and the desktop. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt67339 - Protected design units would not be displayed in the
       Library window of the GUI, even though they are listed when using
       the "vdir" command.
     * dvt79321 - When using -batch mode, continuation lines in a "do"
       file are not interpreted correctly. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt77355 - When the GUI opens with a small initial window size, the
       application will hang until the window size is made larger. This
       issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt77618 - Under some circumstances, use of 'bind' with an
       interface when using +floatparameters could result in a crash on a
       statement using a virtual interface that points to the bind target.
     * dvt68429 - (results) Added the support for alias of a wreal net.
     * dvt77905 - (results) vopt didn't properly handle wildcard ports
       (".*") in bind instances when -pduspec or -tbxhierrefs was
       specified.
     * dvt78506 - When instantiating a Verilog module from VHDL, passing
       an empty string to a parameter could result in memory corruption.
     * dvt78472 - (results) Fixed a bug related to class specializations
       created in extern functions of a class. Before the fix , this bug
       was leading to creation of multiple specializations of a class for
       equivalent set of parameters.
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases redefined macros were not overwriting
       previous macro definitions.
     * dvt77832 - vencrypt would generate syntax errors when the last
       token in a file was a name from a `(tick) name.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) VPI access to class objects (vpiClassObj) is
       in the process of being improved. Users may see some changes, for
       example the name of vpiClassObj objects is now tied to the object
       ID, not the class variable from which the object was originally
       obtained. Class variables and class objects are distinct VPI
       objects and are not expected to have the same name. Class object
       handles are now shared, and become invalid when the kernel releases
       the item due to garbage collection. This is LRM behavior.
     * dvt78513 - Fixed a bug in parsing of modport expression.
     * dvt78508 - Change a Time value error into a new warning if time
       value can not be stored in 32 bits. Rightmost digits greater than
       32 bit number will be truncated. For example 52111111561111ns will
       be truncated to 52111111500000ns.
     * dvt78334 - Fixed a bug when we have multiple packages with same
       name in different libraries.
     * dvt78035 - Fixed a vopt crash in a scenario when interface
       parameter is initialized through hier-ref and hier-ref is a
       structure field. Example :- interface isi_bus_if
       #(isi_bus_pkg::bus_param_t BUS_PARAM =
       isi_bus_pkg::bus_param_defaults) (); localparam ADDR_WIDTH =
       BUS_PARAM.ADDR_WIDTH; endinterface
     * dvt76678 - Fixed a bug where we were not giving error when we were
       assigning nested virtual interface to an interface with different
       parameters.
     * dvt77732 - Fixed a vsim package import export error when some files
       are compiled with -timescale option with vlog and other files are
       not compiled with -timescale. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt77232 - Fixed a bug for bind instances, which resulted in
       simulation getting hanged.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt76976 - Use of access types that references a formal generic
       type would function inconsistently if the actual type is a record
       type.
     * dvt73987 - In Some particular cases, compilation time on windows
       had increased. This has been fixed.
     * dvt72396 - In Some specific cases, an optimization used to give
       incorrect results. This has been fixed.
     * dvt79007 - A package-declared signal used as an element of an array
       begin associated via individual association with a class signal
       procedure formal, where the procedure is declared in a place that
       is not the package, could cause a crash.
     * dvt79195 - Type conversion from a floating point value to an
       integer value of type INTEGER would incorrectly report an error if
       the value was the legal value of -2147483648; likewise for
       2147483647.
     * dvt79119 - The "change" command would work if attempted on an
       access object or member of such.
     * dvt77970 - For some specific cases of aggregate expression,
       evaluation of expressions use to give incorrect error. This has
       been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt78678 - Fixed sccom leaving object files in the current working
       directory on a compile failure.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt75755 - Fixed a bug where assertion control system tasks were
       causing compiler error if used in functions.
     * dvt77160 - Fixed a bug where using %c in severity system task
       ($error etc.) was causing the tool to crash.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM (GUI only) where built-in parameters
       could be expanded incorrectly under certain conditions.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed a bug in VRM pro-active grid checker where
       Actions clubbed into a single grid job were checked as though they
       were separate jobs, resulting in bogus errors.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed two bugs in VRM's handling of array jobs for UGE
       grids.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM GUI such that mergeScript and
       triageScript Actions will now appear in the VRM Results Window in a
       more logical sequence with respect to the other Actions in the
       group under which they were executed.
     * dvt79297 - Fixed problems in VRM GUI where the status counters in
       the VRM Results window were not being updated in a timely manner
       and the Pending counter was not being updated correctly.
     * dvt79272 - Fixed problem in VRM GUI where foreach parameter in RMDB
       was not expanded correctly if the parameter value contains newline
       characters.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.4c
     * dvt78410 - During static analysis of power states and PSTs, the
       tool used to give pessimistic results when dont-cares are used in a
       case where a specific combination of supply values are assumed
       after expanding the dont-cares. This combination is not defined in
       other PSTs sharing the same supplies and hence should be ignored
       during expansion. This has been fixed.
     * dvt77969 - The vopt used to crash when a specific style of
       expression was used in add_power_state command. This expression
       results in a cyclic dependency of UPF objects referred in it. This
       has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.4c
     * dvt77101 - vlog, qverilog, mc2com and vsim have a new option '-vv'
       to print the C/C++ compile/link subprocess command line
       information. Additionally, mc2com and vsim in the MC2 mode will
       print the MC2 subprocess command line information.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.4c
     * dvt27751 - Support two new variations for the "bp" command. Allows
       specifying the line-number only in the command. The command will
       use the source file of the current context. For example:
    bp 57

       The "bp" command will also accept the common gdb syntax of
       "file-name:line-number", for example:
    bp dut.sv:57

       Here is the full usage description for the "bp" command:
# Usage:
# HDL breakpoints:
#  bp location [options] [{command ...}]
#    location: {[filename] line_number | filename:line_number | in task_or_fcn}
#    options: [-id id#] [-label label] [-disable] [-uvm] [[-inst region]...]
#             [-cond {condition_expression}] [-appendinst]
#
# C breakpoints:
#  bp -c location [options]
#    location: {function_name | line_number | filename:line_number | *0xhex_addr
ess}
#    options: [-disable] [[-inst {systemc_module_instance_name}]...]
#             [-cond {condition_expression}] [-appendinst]
#
# Information:
#   bp [-query filename [line_number [line_number]]]

     * dvt30446 - Two enhancements have been added to the run & step
       commands, reporting of the simulation time and delta when the run
       operation completes, and reporting the run status when the run
       operation completes. These reports are enabled by setting the
       preference variable PrefMain(noRunTimeMsg) and
       PrefMain(noRunStatusMsg) respectively to 0. Here is an example of
       these reports:

VSIM 1> run 105
VSIM 2> set PrefMain(noRunTimeMsg) 0
# 0
VSIM 3> run 112
# Time: @217 ns 0
VSIM 4> set PrefMain(noRunStatusMsg) 0
# 0
VSIM 5> run 100
# Time: @317 ns 0
# Status: ready end
VSIM 6> set PrefMain(noRunTimeMsg) 1
# 1
VSIM 7> run 50
# Status: ready end
VSIM 8> set PrefMain(noRunStatusMsg) 1
# 1
VSIM 9> run 55
VSIM 10>

     * dvt9844 - The "when" command has been enhanced to support repeating
       time breakpoints. The -repeat switch works with "when" breakpoint
       expressions involving time ($now). Normally expressions involving
       $now will only trigger once. With the -repeat option the "when"
       breakpoint will reestablish the breakpoint when triggered so that
       it will fire again for the next time period.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.4c
     * dvt78126 - (results) An LRM extension has been added to allow the
       use of array reduction methods on multi-dimensional unpacked
       arrays, without the need of using a 'with' clause. To use this,
       specify "-svext=ared" (for array reduction) on the vlog
       command-line. In that case, a multi-dimensional unpacked array will
       be treated as if it had a single dimension
       [0:total_number_of_elements-1].
     * dvt71352 - (results) Support of pulse Error/Reject behavior on
       INTERCONNECT delays on optimized cell inputs. Earlier error 12031
       was reported for such cases.
     * dvt76748 - -gblso option has been enhanced to accept multiple
       shared objects.
       -gblso <shared_obj>[,<shared_obj>...]
       When multiple shared objects are specified, they will first be
       merged internally and then loaded as single shared object.
     * dvt77101 - Warnings generated during the C/C++ source file
       compilation will be echoed to stdout by default.
       Additionally, vlog and qverilog have a new option -ccwarn
       [on|off|verbose|strict].
       The -ccwarn option will control the GNU warning/error flags for the
       C/C++ files compilation.
       Options are:
       on (default): compiles with -Wreturn-type, -Wimplicit,
       -Wuninitialized, -Wmissing-declarations gcc options
       off: compiles without any warning options
       verbose: compiles with the -Wall gcc option
       strict: compiles with the -Werror gcc option

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.4c
     * dvt78301 - vcover parallelmerge -ucdbname option is now replaced
       with -dbname option. New option will accept both UCDB and
       CoverStore test database files selection for the merge. Default
       -dbname value for UCDB and CoverStore is '*.ucdb' and '*'
       respectively.
     * dvt79256 - vcover ranktest now accepts merged coverstores as inputs

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4c
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM (GUI only) where the target of an
       "-include" command-line is a repeating Runnable.
     * [nodvtid] - Added "-mseed" command-line option to vrun (VRM) to
       seed internal random number generator.
     * [nodvtid] - Modified GetFileContents utility procedure (VRM) to
       ignore escaped newline characters.
     * dvt76492 - Added support in VRM for automated testlist expansion
       using a common testlist format:
          + The "testlist" attribute is now recognized on "runnable"
            elements.
          + Added new utility procedures GetMostRecentFile and
            GetMostRecentFileContents.
          + Added new utility procedures ExpandTestlist and
            GetTestlistTokens.
     * [nodvtid] - By default, the GetNextIteration user-definable
       procedure in VRM will return compound tokens when foreach tokens
       include characters other than the leading asterisk (ie: test1-1,
       test1-2, etc when the foreach token is "*1"). This is to prevent
       the inadvertent generation of duplicate tokens.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In VRM, the "testname" parameter is recognized
       for group Runnables. That means a mergeScript or triageScript
       Action now inherits the testname under which it runs and the
       preScript and postScript of a group Runnable which defines a
       non-blank "testname" parameter are considered part of the same
       test. The "testname" parameter should only be defined in task
       Runnables if the intention is to flag only the leaf-level
       execScript Actions as tests.
     * dvt78588 - In VRM, when the "-noautomergedelete" command-line
       option is specified, the testplan, if any, is deleted from any
       merged UCDB files to which tests from that regression run are
       merged. A new "-notplandelete" command-line option prevents the
       testplan from being deleted. For now, the testplan deletion is
       ignored with a warning when the merged UCDB is a coverstore.
     * dvt76500 - VRM named queues maxrunning attribute is now considered
       a limit on the number of concurrently running jobs. Consequently, a
       multi-action fixed-list clubbed group, enabled by maxclubbing, is
       considered a single job; if maxrunning and maxclubbing are set to m
       and n respectively, then the named queue can be running a maximum
       of m jobs each containing n actions
     * dvt76500 - VRM multi-action jobs, fixed-list (maxclubbing) and
       array jobs (maxarray), combine an unlimited number of actions when
       their controlling attributes are set to 0.
     * dvt77656 - (results) Formal items linked with testplans by rules
       are now displayed in Tracker window like regular objects using
       their own icon.
     * dvt78842 - (results) The tplanref and tplansection attribute names
       are now supported for tests to link with specified testplan
       sections. The tplanref attribute is for specifying target testplan
       section's reference number, and the tplansection attribute is for
       specifying the full hierarchical path of the target testplan
       section.
     * dvt78894 - (results) The tplansection is now supported as an
       attribute name in HDL source code for specifying testplan scope
       hierarchy paths to link with. It also works when used within
       option.comment and type_option.comment of covergroups, coverpoints,
       and crosses.
