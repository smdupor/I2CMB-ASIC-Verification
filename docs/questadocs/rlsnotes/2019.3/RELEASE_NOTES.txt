   Key Information
     * There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1 or 2019.2 or
       2019.3. However, if you are migrating to 2019.3 from a release like
       10.6 and older, please note that release 2019.3 uses FLEXnet
       v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * The Register Assistant version included within this release has
       been upgraded to RUVM/2019.3.
       RUVM/2019.3 is a native 64-bit application.

   Release Announcements in 2019.3
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge
       Article MG596568 on SupportNet.
       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have
       discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to
       support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until
       their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid
       2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 2019.3

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of
       uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated
       with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT
       mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual
       variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left
       unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is
       now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode
       parameters in the above cases.
     * QSIM-56234 - (results) In certain cases, association of array
       subelements in ports was leading to incorrect results. This has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-56012 - (results) When attributes 'left, 'right, 'length,
       'low, 'high and 'range were applied to an unconstrained array, they
       lead to a crash. This is now an error.

   General Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) For constrained random stimulus,
       random results for a given seed are consistent across all platforms
       and variants of platforms.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2019.3
     * QSIM-55187 - Certain lists of expressions, as in a concatenation,
       could cause a compiler crash if there was a missing element; this
       is a syntax error now correctly handled.
     * QSIM-56462 - An index variable in a streaming concat expression
       like b1 = {>> {b2 with [0 +: len]}} would sometimes generate an
       error at vsim time because the variable "len" was expected to be a
       constant expression. The typical error was:<br>
       ** Error: (vsim-3044) Usage of 'mod.len' inconsistent with
       'register' object.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 2019.3
     * QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of
       uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated
       with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT
       mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual
       variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left
       unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is
       now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode
       parameters in the above cases.
     * QSIM-56234 - (results) In certain cases, association of array
       subelements in ports was leading to incorrect results. This has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-56012 - (results) When attributes 'left, 'right, 'length,
       'low, 'high and 'range were applied to an unconstrained array, they
       lead to a crash. This is now an error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 2019.3
     * QSIM-55481 - Fix scparse to handle C++11 scoped enums.
     * QSIM-57389 - Fixed sccom-6000 error caused by a corrupt debug
       database generated by scparse in cases where member functions had
       many arguments.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 2019.3
     * VM-11371 - Fixed performance issue where VRM GUI would appear to
       stop responding to input for a significant time when opening a VRM
       Results pane on a regression which contains a large number (ie:
       1000s) of scripts and/or tests.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 2019.3
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) For constrained random stimulus,
       random results for a given seed are consistent across all platforms
       and variants of platforms.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 2019.3
     * [nodvtid] - The vopt -linedebug option is being deprecated. A
       warning message is issued when this option is used.
