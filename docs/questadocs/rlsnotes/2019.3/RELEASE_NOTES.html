<p /><a name="keyinfo"></a><font size="5"><b>Key Information</b></font>
<ul><li><p>
There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1 or 2019.2 or 2019.3. However, if you are migrating to 2019.3 from a release like 10.6 and older, please note that release 2019.3 uses FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

</p><p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

</p><p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

</p><p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
</p><ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 </li><li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 </li><li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 </li><li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
</li></ul></li>
 <li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li>The Register Assistant version included within this release has been upgraded to RUVM/2019.3.<br /><br />RUVM/2019.3 is a native 64-bit application. <br /><br /> </li>

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

 <li>Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode parameters in the above cases.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56234 - (results)  In certain cases, association of array subelements in ports was leading to incorrect results. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56012 - (results) When attributes 'left, 'right, 'length, 'low, 'high and 'range were applied to an unconstrained array, they lead to a crash. This is now an error.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source, results) For constrained random stimulus, random results for a given seed are consistent

<ul><li>QSIM-55187 - Certain lists of expressions, as in a concatenation, could cause a compiler crash if there was a missing element; this is a syntax error now correctly handled.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56462 - An index variable in a streaming concat expression like b1 = {&gt;&gt; {b2 with [0 +: len]}} would sometimes generate an error at vsim time because the variable &quot;len&quot; was expected to be a constant expression.  The typical error was:&lt;br&gt;<br /> ** Error: (vsim-3044) Usage of 'mod.len' inconsistent with 'register' object.<br /> <br /><br /></li>
