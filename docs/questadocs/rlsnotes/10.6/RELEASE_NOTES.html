<p /><a name="keyinfo"></a><font size="5"><b>Key Information</b></font>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - As part of our IEEE 1735 encryption work, we have deprecated some older keys, and use of these keys during encryption will trigger a warning. This warning may be ignored if you want to continue to encrypt with the deprecated keys. We have also introduced a new methodology for key deprecation based on file presence. This recognizes that the decision to deprecate may be made either by the Questa encrypt agent tool, or by the end user, most commonly as a site-management decision. The presence of a file named &lt;keyname&gt;.deprecated in the installation subdirectory /keyring will trigger this warning for &lt;keyname&gt;. The CWD is also checked for deprecation files. These files may be managed by the CAD tools team to indicate that keys are, or are not, deprecated.</li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - <p>
There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) Modports declared within generate blocks within interfaces have been removed from the language by the IEEE.  This is Mantis item 343.</li>
 <li>dvt84871 - (results) vsim crashed when annotating SDF to a full specify path ( "*>") with path selects on source and destination terminals. This happened only when the specify block contained more than 64 paths and the width of the source and destination part-selects were different. E.g. (a[17:9] *> y[36:18]) = (0);</li>
 <li>dvt84969 - (results) Specifying a VHDL instance to $asserton or $assertoff didn't affect the assert statements. It caused error (vsim-8111) to be emitted, indicating no matching object was found.</li>
 <li>dvt66421 - (results) When vsim was run with any "-radix" other than "binary", UVM backdoor functions uvm_hdl_deposit and uvm_hdl_force didn't deposit/force the correct value into VHDL data objects.</li>
 <li>dvt87030 - (results) Force/Release on loconn was not handled properly in case of cell optimization, causing a simulation mismatch when run without +acc=c</li>
 <li>dvt85937 - (results) Fixed the issues that DPI disable protocol was not followed when a thread is terminated either by "disable fork" or "process:kill"</li>
 <li>dvt87351 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail with a spurious constraint contradiction related to an interaction between constraints involving array.size expressions and if-else constraints having a logical-and implicant/alternate constraint. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt85666 - (results) In some cases, randomize() involving array.sum constraints would generate poor solution distributions on the random elements of array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Fixed a bug in Questa's support of nested classes. Extending a nested class whose parent class is parameterised was not supported. This has been supported now.
For example , the following example now works :

<pre>
class base#(int A = 1);
    class base_inner;
    endclass
endclass

class derived#(int A = 1) extends base#(A);
      class derived_inner extends base_inner;
      endclass
endclass

</pre></li>
 <li>dvt82320 - (results) Fixed a bug in supporting class specializations which are based on associative arrays using a wild card (*)
For example the following now works correctly.
<pre>
class A#(type T = int);
endclass
class B;
typedef bit abc[*];
A#(abc) a;
endclass
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt87755 - (results) Stop giving warning vsim-SDF-8745 for valid retain Values. 
Support enhanced to take care of null values. </li>
 <li>dvt89119 - (results) In GUI mode, the VSIM "restart" command would ignore a specified "-sv_seed <seed>" option if "-f" is not also specified. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results)  Fix failure to annotate limit to timing check where condition comes from LHS of simple "assign".</li>
 <li>dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.</li>
 <li>dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After 
the 'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.</li>
 <li>dvt85177 - (results) Improved the reporting of vsim arguments after loading an elaboration or checkpoint run.</li>
 <li>dvt83519 - (results) Report vsim arguments with which elaboration or checkpoint was created.</li>
 <li>dvt69035 - (results) Support of -seq_udp_delay <delay> added. Specify a constant delay for all sequential UDP's in the design and set all other structural delays to zero</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support for array ordering methods 'sort', 'rsort' and 'reverse' for associative arrays. A suppressible error is shown in these cases. Use of -permissive/-suppress allows the usage. Svext 'omaa' is removed now, which was added for support of 'shuffle' method. Now, method 'shuffle' is supported in the same way as other array ordering methods.</li>
 <li>dvt87656 - (results) The implicit sensitivity for @* has been enhanced beyond the LRM specification to include bit-selects and part-selects in the sensitivity according to the same rule for always_comb, which is to use the "longest static prefix" of any select expressions read in the block rather than the identifier for the whole variable. This can improve performance and better match the intention of the code. Use the compiler option -svext=sas to revert back to the old behavior.</li>
 <li>dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of association element". This has been fixed. </li>
 <li>dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256, of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemC  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (results) sccom would invoke scparse with the '--c++0x' option by default, which would enable the c++11 standard. The enabling of the c++11 standard by default would lead to scparse compilation errors in certain cases, while the g++ compilation would run fine. sccom has been fixed not to pass '--c++0x' by default. If a design has c++11 constructs, sccom needs to be invoked with the '-std=c++11' option so that both, g++ and scparse will run with the c++11 standard enabled during compilation.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt90298 - (results) A VHDL array connected to a Verilog nettype or interconnect array port declared with packed dimensions was connected in reverse order.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt87311 - (source) Following arguments for vopt option '-pa_enable' has been enabled by default
-pa_enable=libertypamodel
-pa_enable=ignoresupplyconn

Following arguments for vopt option '-pa_upfextensions' has been enabled by default

-pa_upfextensions=autovctgnd
-pa_upfextensions=genericretcond
-pa_upfextensions=relatedsnet

</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source, results) Added support for bit blasted reporting of retained signals in report.pa.txt using vopt option -pa_genrpt=pa+b.  </li>
 <li>dvt88657 - (source, results) Added Support for new UPF 3.0 command set_variation</li>
 <li>dvt90658 - (results) Added support to correctly parse nested comments in liberty files under an option. option -pa_libertyNestedCmnts can be used to enable parsing of nested comments in liberty files.</li>
 <li>dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being driven by constants 
E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1;
Questa PASim corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being driven by constants.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Any PA message(except UPF parsing error/warning) occurring more than a default limit(50) will be suppressed from vopt logfile.<br>
Also a message report will be generated at " < pa_reportdir >/msg.vopt.log" to see the complete messages.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) PA reports will now be generated inside directory "pa_reports" instead of current working directory(cwd).</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support of upf defined logic ports in UPF commands - set_isolation, set_level_shifter, set_repeater and set_port_attributes. It has been enabled under vopt option -pa_enable=logicconnectivity.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support to honor power states defined on repeater_supply_set of set_repeater command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support to honor power states defined on driver_supply/repeater_supply mentioned in set_port_attributes command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support to honor power states defined on input_supply_set/output_supply_set/internal_supply_set of set_level_shifter command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT and NORMAL.</li>
 <li>dvt83703 - (results) Added support for option -available_supplies of UPF command create_power_domain</li>
 <li>dvt83702 - (results) Added support for option -atomic of UPF command create_power_domain</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt87194 - (results) simstats commands will now print memory data in scaled format, instead of earlier behavior of printing in Kb format. This change will make output consistent with the default output of -stats option. User can still get older behavior by using 'kb' option with these commands, for example 'simstats kb', 'simstats verbose kb'.

simstatslist command will still print unscaled memory data, as earlier.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first 10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked. Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= &lt;i &gt;'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the bin will be reported.</li>
 <li>dvt78649 - (results) The reporting of non-masking conditions for ternary expressions is enhanced by adding the state of select expression for implicant and alternate branches. The FEC report now shows the state of select condition required to cover a term in the implicant or alternate branch alongwith other non-masking conditions. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt86458 - (source) VRM testlist functionality now automatically populates the testname parameter using the exact entry in the testlist. In order to append the seed or repeat to the testname, %s and %n should be specified in the testlist directly.</li>
 <li>dvt83252 - (results) A problem has been fixed that prevented parameters specified in a parent testplan from being correctly passed down to a child testplan.</li>
 <li>dvt87784 - (results) The cover directive coverage number reported within some summary reports has been fixed.
This number is 'coverage by instance'. In some cases is was being reported as the sum of 'coverage by instance' and 'coverage by DU'.</li>
 <li>dvt75566 - (results) Ranktest now provides a way to selectively group tests based on attribute values, such that ranktest will treat them as one combined object.
<PRE>
Four new switches are:
    -groupby <attribute>[=< value >]  --  Specifies which attribute within the UCDB test record to group tests by.
    -groupfilter < regex >  --  Specifies a regular expression match to apply to the attribute value being grouped, to match on a specific part of the attribute value itself.
    -norun -- Display groups without ranking. Allows you to visualize grouping.
    -recursive  -- Enables recursive ranking, items which make up a group, will in turn be ranked against one another.

   NOTE: The output from ranktest has been altered from that of past releases (when grouping as well as when not grouping).
   NOTE: The switches -concise and -verbose have been removed.
</PRE> </li>
 <li>dvt80352 - (results) "vcover report ... < rankfile >" is a new feature."vcover report" never accepted rank files in the past. The four "show" options below are only valid when "vcover report ..." is given a rankfile.
<PRE> 
        New arguments:
            -showucdb
            -showattr < attr[,< attr >]+
            -showincr
            -showbincounts

The following pre-existing options have a new/different behavior when 
"vcover report ..." is given a rankfile:
      -precision < int >
      -assert
      -code [bcesf(t|x)]
      -codeAll
      -cvg
      -directive
The global arguments are supported:
      -suppress ...
      -error ...
      -note ...
      -warning ...
      -stats ...

Only the arguments listed above work with rankfile reporting. 
None of the four rankfile reporting "show" arguments work with 
generic coverage reporting.
</PRE> </li>
 <li>dvt91555 - (results) The -fixedtotalcov option is added in vcover trend html report to display the actual total coverage values in Coverage Summary graph irrespective of selected coverage types in that graph. If no coverage type is selected then only the total coverage is displayed in that graph.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt90005 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the Code Coverage Analysis window
using FSM type and in "by file" mode did not work.  It resulted in the warning message:
# ** Warning: (vish-4036) The 'coverage exclude' command had no effect on some/all objects because
# no matching coverage data was found.

this has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be exclude with no warning.
</li>
 <li>dvt90759 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type did not work. It resulted in the 4014 warning message: "no matching object found".  This has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be exclude with no warning. </li>
 <li>dvt90591 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Statement, Branch, and Expression coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied and some items of a multi-item line were not being displayed, the item numbers for the remaining displayed items could be incorrect.   In addition, if the "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu was then applied to the incorrecly numbered displaye item, the exclude would be applied to the incorrect item.  This has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt88300 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Condition (and other) coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied, some items would be displayed when they should be hidden by the filtering and vice versa.  This has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt90155 - A force operation on a wreal interconnect would resault in a crash.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

 <li>dvt87420 - Fixed a crash in vsim in a corner scenario. If we have a module say top and some signal is passed to an interface from this module, which is further passed to another interface instantiated in first interface.

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - For IP protection using encryption for VHDL and SV, we have added a new public key named MGC-VERIF-SIM-RSA-2 that has 2048 bit key length.  This enhances our security and conforms to the recommendations in IEEE 1735-2014.  All users of IP protection are encouraged to begin using this key.  IP authors should verify that their Modelsim and Questasim product version requirements are satisfied.  This key is not supported in older releases.</li>
 <li>dvt84671 - For IP protection in VHDL and SV, a new 2048 bit public key named MGC-VERIF-SIM-RSA-2 has been added.  This provides enhanced security and conforms to recommendations in IEEE 1735-2014.  IP authors are encouraged to start using this key immediately.  They should confirm that the supported Modelsim and Questa versions for this key satisfy their needs.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - -memopt[=n] vopt option has been added to enable/disable peak memory optimization. Mode "n" values are 0,1,2,3,4. Mode 3 is default on. Mode 0 disables this optimization. Mode 1 & 2 enables less aggressive memory optimization. Mode 4 enables more aggressive memory optimization.</li>
 <li>dvt78423 - When the design unit being instantiated was contained inside library 'work', and the design unit of the scope
of the instantiation statement was contained in a library that was not named 'work', vopt (and vsim in -novopt flow)
would fail to find the instantiated design unit in spite of using -L work. Using -L ./work would make the test
pass. This has been fixed, and now -L ./work is no longer required.</li>
 <li>dvt85061 - Added a sub-option 'compress' to option -createlib to automatically create compressed missing libraries.
i.e. whenever a new library is created based on -createlib option, it is created compressed. The syntax
is -createlib=compress.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Usability improvements and bug fixes have been made to Questa's library search features. There are no known incompatibilities with earlier library search operations. All working designs will continue to elaborate as they have in the past. 
<br>
The following new features have been added to Questa's library search algorithm:<br>
1. A new option called -Ldir has been added to vopt and vsim.<br>
This option allows users to pass container folders for the libraries specified with -L/-Lf options. Once a container folder has been specified, the libraries contained in this folder can be directly referenced using their logical names. When multiple -Ldir options are used, the tool searches in the order in which -Ldir paths are specified on the command line. $cwd is always searched before any -Ldir options, as if there was an implicit "-Ldir ." specified first on the command line.
<br>
2. Vopt now detects inconsistencies between its -L/-Lf options and the options passed to vlog. Any inconsistency that can possibly result in a difference in the composition of the design will generate a warning.<br>

3. A new option -libverbose=libmap has been added to display library map pattern matching information during compilation.
<br>
4. Some design units were missing source information next to their loading messages with -libverbose=prlib. This has been fixed. All design units now consistently show their source libraries when -libverbose=prlib is used.<br>

5. A new option -work has been added to vsim. This is an optional option; When used, it would override the library in which vsim writes the optimized design generated by the internally invoked vopt command in the 2-step flow.
<br>
6. Error messages vsim-19 and vopt-19, generated for non-existent -L/-Lf libraries, are now suppressible.</li>
 <li>dvt87926 - Capacity report generation has been enhanced to show the point of allocation as well as the point of declaration. The current vsim option -capacity has been enhanced to -capacity[=line]. Now, with -capacity=line, point of allocation is also preserved. The user can write point of allocation (line) based report using the command 'write report -capacity -l -line'. If -line option is not used in the 'write report -capacity' command, the report will be generated based on declaration. Vsim has to be run with -capacity=line to print line based capacity report. 
Please note, the GUI window is not enhanced yet and it still shows declaration based view.</li>
 <li>dvt87194 - (results) simstats commands will now print memory data in scaled format, instead of earlier behavior of printing in Kb format. This change will make output consistent with the default output of -stats option. User can still get older behavior by using 'kb' option with these commands, for example 'simstats kb', 'simstats verbose kb'.

simstatslist command will still print unscaled memory data, as earlier.
</li>
 <li>dvt84129 - Added the bsaif support for following System Verilog types:
- reg, logic and bit
- struct and arrays (up to 3 Dimensional) of reg, logic and bit
- other complex types created using the above mentioned basic types. 
These types can now be used with "power add", "power on", "power off" and "power reset" commands
Not Supported types: Integers, enums, reals, strings.</li>
 <li>dvt92311 - Added a new vsim option -capstats and a new commands called capstats to print out capstats report. This report generates complete memory usage of the design.
 The capstats option is defined as follows:
<pre>
-capstats[=&ltargs&gt] 
where &ltargs&gt are all,classes,qdas,vmems,solver,assertions,cvg,eor and filename=&ltfile_name&gt. The arguments can be specified separated by comma or '+'.
</pre>
If -capstats is specified without any arguments, a summary capstats report is generated at the end of simulation. If -capstats is specified with argument 'eor', a summary capstats report is generated at the end of each run command.<br>
A verbose report can be generated if vsim is invoked with -capacity option.
The level of verbosity in the report can be controlled by specifying options as follows:<br>
If -capstats is specified with argument 'all', a complete verbose report is generated. If -capstats is specified with arguments 'classes','qdas','vmems','solver','assertions' or 'cvg', a verbose report is generated for the specified types.
<br>
The report is printed in the transcript file if no filename is specified.
<br>
<br>

The capstats command has been modified as follows:
<pre>
capstats [-all] [-classes] [-qdas] [-vmems] [-solver] [-assertions] [-cvg] [&lt filename&gt]
</pre>

A summary capstats report is generated if no arguments are specified. <br>
The report can be redirected to a file by specifying the file name otherwise the report is generated in the transcript file.<br>
A full verbose report can be generated by specifying option 'all'.<br>

A partial verbose report can be generated for specific types by specifying those options. Please note that the verbose report is only generated if vsim is run with -capacity option.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - The "find signals", "find nets", and "find instances" commands are now supported in -batch mode.</li>
 <li>dvt15443 - When vsim crashes with SIGSEGV signal, we were only giving HDL call stack. But, it wasn't complete stack in case of the crash in user's C code (like DPI/PLI etc). Now, vsim will generate stacktrace file and print full stacktrace in transcript as well, in addition to existing HDL call stack. </li>

 <li>[nodvtid]  - vlog's -E output would not emit `line directives with anything other than '0' for the "level" parameter.  Valid values for the "level" parameter are 0, 1 or 2.</li>
 <li>dvt86512 - Allowed syntax "{class_item_qualifier} pure virtual method_prototype;" in an abstract class with -suppress and -permissive.</li>
 <li>dvt22338 - Questa used to report an error on parsing declarations present in $unit scope of library files passed through -v option. In -mfcu mode, all the global declarations present in both compile file and library files specified through -v will be lumped together in a single $unit scope. In -sfcu mode, a local $unit scope will be created for a library file passed through -v option if this file has global declarations.</li>
 <li>dvt85045 - Vsim option -printforces has been added and it will enable user to print forces/releases during the simulation in the following format:

Time 0 ns : force /tb/dut/a 0
Time 10 ns : release /tb/dut/a
Time 100 ns : force /tb/dut/a 1</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) Modports declared within generate blocks within interfaces have been removed from the language by the IEEE.  This is Mantis item 343.</li>
 <li>dvt76166 - Questa has supported the SystemVerilog interface self-reference using an interace::self() syntax. This enhancement adds support for an interface self-reference using the name of the interface which may be more portable.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support for array ordering methods 'sort', 'rsort' and 'reverse' for associative arrays. A suppressible error is shown in these cases. Use of -permissive/-suppress allows the usage. Svext 'omaa' is removed now, which was added for support of 'shuffle' method. Now, method 'shuffle' is supported in the same way as other array ordering methods.</li>
 <li>dvt87656 - (results) The implicit sensitivity for @* has been enhanced beyond the LRM specification to include bit-selects and part-selects in the sensitivity according to the same rule for always_comb, which is to use the "longest static prefix" of any select expressions read in the block rather than the identifier for the whole variable. This can improve performance and better match the intention of the code. Use the compiler option -svext=sas to revert back to the old behavior.</li>
 <li>dvt89504 - Supported the connection of array of interface instance passed as a port to instance array.
Example:-
intf i [p1:0][p2:0](); // interface array
bot b[p1:0](i); // This will connect each b[j] to i[j]</li>
 <li>dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.</li>
 <li>dvt80851 - This enhancement allows functions without return values. In these cases we would return the default value of the return type of

  if (flag)
    return 1;
  else
    return;//return default value of int

</pre></li>
 <li>dvt26099 - Allow system verilog keyword "automatic" to be used with class constructors ("new" function).</li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - vcover parallelmerge has been enhanced to optimize number of parallel merge jobs such that each merge job will have at least 2 files to merge. 
For example, if user asks 8 files to merge with 8 parallel jobs, parallelmerge would run 8 parallel merge jobs with 1 file each. With this enhancement, parallelmerge will automatically reduce the number of parallel merge jobs to 4.</li>
 <li>dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first 10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked. Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= &lt;i &gt;'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the bin will be reported.</li>
 <li>dvt78649 - (results) The reporting of non-masking conditions for ternary expressions is enhanced by adding the state of select expression for implicant and alternate branches. The FEC report now shows the state of select condition required to cover a term in the implicant or alternate branch alongwith other non-masking conditions. </li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - <br>
First phase of Adaptive exclusion support has been added. Before this support, user had to rewrite the exclusion commands every time RTL used to change. Now tool is able to adapt the change in the RTL while applying the exclusions generated via older versions of the design.
<br>
To enable the feature, -adaptive switch (in addition to other coverage switches) is needed in vopt. 
<br>
To generate the adaptive exclusion report, please use following command :
<br>
coverage report -excluded -adaptive -file adapt.do
<br>

<ul><li>dvt75566 - (results) Ranktest now provides a way to selectively group tests based on attribute values, such that ranktest will treat them as one combined object.
<PRE>
Four new switches are:
    -groupby <attribute>[=< value >]  --  Specifies which attribute within the UCDB test record to group tests by.
    -groupfilter < regex >  --  Specifies a regular expression match to apply to the attribute value being grouped, to match on a specific part of the attribute value itself.
    -norun -- Display groups without ranking. Allows you to visualize grouping.
    -recursive  -- Enables recursive ranking, items which make up a group, will in turn be ranked against one another.

   NOTE: The output from ranktest has been altered from that of past releases (when grouping as well as when not grouping).
   NOTE: The switches -concise and -verbose have been removed.
</PRE> </li>
 <li>dvt80352 - (results) "vcover report ... < rankfile >" is a new feature."vcover report" never accepted rank files in the past. The four "show" options below are only valid when "vcover report ..." is given a rankfile.
<PRE> 
        New arguments:
            -showucdb
            -showattr < attr[,< attr >]+
            -showincr
            -showbincounts

The following pre-existing options have a new/different behavior when 
"vcover report ..." is given a rankfile:
      -precision < int >
      -assert
      -code [bcesf(t|x)]
      -codeAll
      -cvg
      -directive
The global arguments are supported:
      -suppress ...
      -error ...
      -note ...
      -warning ...
      -stats ...

Only the arguments listed above work with rankfile reporting. 
None of the four rankfile reporting "show" arguments work with 
generic coverage reporting.
</PRE> </li>
 <li>dvt90413 - The "vcover merge" '-ignoredusig' argument is deprecated. Instead, use the new '-mergedesigndiffs' argument.
The warning messages still appear when the '-mergedesigndiffs' argument is used. Note: Both '-ignoredusig' and '-mergedesigndiffs' are ignored for the coverstore case.</li>
 <li>dvt89824 - Two routines have been added to the UCDB API.
<pre>
/*
 * ucdb_GetTestIndex()
 *
 * Return the index value for test record.
 * Return -1 if an error occurs.
 */
int
ucdb_GetTestIndex(ucdbT db, ucdbTestT test);

/*
 * ucdb_GetIthTest()
 *
 * Return the test record having the indicated index value.
 * Return NULL if an error occurs.
 */
ucdbTestT
ucdb_GetIthTest(ucdbT db, int index);
</pre></li>
 <li>dvt91555 - (results) The -fixedtotalcov option is added in vcover trend html report to display the actual total coverage values in Coverage Summary graph irrespective of selected coverage types in that graph. If no coverage type is selected then only the total coverage is displayed in that graph.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Regression Author(RAuth) is a newly added VRM feature. RAuth is a web based interface allowing the user to easily create an RMDB. The generated RMDB is used to run VRM . In order to use the feature use the command vrun -author. The user will be prompted to agree to creating "suites" directory where data used in generating the RMDBs for different suites are stored. Once agreed, a web-based interface will open where the user can create and manage regression suites. In order to run RAuth, it is recommended to have at least python version 2.6.7, and a recent browser version (firefox 42 and chrome 47 and Internet Explorer 11) Older versions might show incorrect behaviour. Logs are redirected to a file that is named author_xxxxx.log, where xxxxx changes with every run. The below options are available when using the "vrun -author" command:
  vrun -author
    Launch Regression Author (regression suite generation tool)
      -cwd                      Look for content files in current directory
      -port <number>            Specify listening port for server-only mode
      -server                   Server-only mode, suppress launching of browser
      -suites <path>            Specify path to save JSON configuration files
      -authorlog <path>         Specify path to log file
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Tests listed in a VRM testlist file now support the "%n" and "%s" tokens in parameter overrides.</li>
 <li>dvt86458 - (source) VRM testlist functionality now automatically populates the testname parameter using the exact entry in the testlist. In order to append the seed or repeat to the testname, %s and %n should be specified in the testlist directly.</li>
