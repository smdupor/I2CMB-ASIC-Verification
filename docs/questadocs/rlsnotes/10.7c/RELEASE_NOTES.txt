   Key Information
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license
       servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
          + The vlog -wireasinterconnect option is deprecated due to
            performance issues, and a warning message is issued to that
            effect when used. The vopt -rnmautointeconnect option is
            preferred because it takes advantage of the vopt analysis to
            more selectively convert wires to interconnect. Only wires
            connected upwards from real/wreal/nettype/interconnect ports
            are converted.
          + QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process
            of deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
            recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
            (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
            process starts with a warning if this option is used, which
            will become an error in later releases. The reason for this
            change is to remove the source ambiguities referenced by the
            compilation libraries. An encrypted compilation is a
            compilation of the post-encryption sources and must not retain
            any association with pre-encryption sources. This principle is
            reinforced by maintaining a two-step flow.

       Release Announcements in 10.7c

     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.7c

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.

       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of
       deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
       recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
       (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
       process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will
       become an error in later releases. The reason for this change is to

       libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the
       post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with
       pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining
       a two-step flow.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents
       of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not
       included. Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are
       also excluded. Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed"
       are filtered out of logging.
     * QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is
       connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output
       was incorrect. This has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.7c
     * QSIM-21724 - The logging of nets or registers of types containing
       SV unions has several issues which would lead to crashes or the
       display of incorrect data. These issues have been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7c
     * QSIM-50272 - The vencrypt feature "-auto3protect" could not
       properly handle macro call syntax in the port list of a module.
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7c
     * QSIM-5497 - For some specific cases of type conversions used in the
       unbound components, vsim used to crash. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-10698 - The verilog reserved word "global" was not supported
       in VHDL packages with -mixedsvvh switch. This has been supported
       now.
     * VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents
       of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not
       included. Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are
       also excluded. Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed"
       are filtered out of logging.
     * QSIM-43580 - A port association that is an aggregate with an OTHERS
       choice, for a constrained port that is an array-of-array, and where
       those constraints are globally static, could result in either a
       compiler internal error or a run-time simulator error about
       mismatched array lengths.
     * QSIM-26474 - In certain specific cases usage of slice expressions
       inside loop statements used to result in a crash. This has been
       fixed.
     * QSIM-32597 - In certain specific cases usage of nested if
       statements resulted in a crash due to certain optimizations. This
       has been fixed.
     * QSIM-50516 - In some case vopt generate an internal error or bad
       code for a configuration. This would occur if a generic or port of
       a component being configuration was used anywhere other than the
       port/generic map.
     * QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is
       connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output
       was incorrect. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-3588 - For some specific cases of for generates, vsim use to
       crash. This has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.7c
     * VM-8783 - Fixed bug where "-inputsfile" option to "triage passfail"
       command wasn't being recognized.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.7c
     * QSIM-879 - Added support for matching bit-blasted scalar port in
       rtl with normal non-escaped port names in SDF under switch
       "-sdfallowvlogescapeport".
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.7c
     * QSIM-35477 - The SourceDir variable has improved the remapping
       behavior for finding source files. Instead of having to define each
       source directory location, defining a single root source directory
       should be sufficient to find any source file within the directory
       sub-tree, as long as the sub-tree path is the same as the original.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7c
     * [nodvtid] - Verilog design units' library signatures have changed
       from previous versions of 10.7. This requires a refresh when using
       previous 10.7 libraries in 10.7c.
