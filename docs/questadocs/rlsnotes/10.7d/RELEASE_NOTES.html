<ul><li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li><p>
This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 <li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 <li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 <li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
</li>
 <li>QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will become an error in later releases.
The reason for this change is to remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining a two-step flow.</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<ul><li>QSIM-197 - (source, results) The following changes were made in the HDL package functions to align them with UPF LRM 3.1:<br>
<ol>
<li>Added support for singleton class object upfDesignT.
<li>Added field current_simstate on native UPF object upfPdSsObjT to fetch current simstate of power domains or supply sets.
<li>Type definition of upfHandleT has been changed from chandle to SV int.
</ol>
<p>
Now we strictly follow the LRM guideline, which says that the handles to properties and iterators may be reused and are not valid for comparison.
<p>
10.7: In order to use HDL package functions in 10.7, User needs to make changes in the modelsim.ini file to point the mtiUPF to $MODEL_TECH/../upf_lib-3.1
</li>
 <li>QSIM-840 - (source, results) Instantaneously corrupting the value of LHS in delayed continuos assignment on power down.<br /></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) The  assertion control option &quot;-pa_enable=forceasrtoffpwrdown&quot; has been improved to honor user's assertion control system task(e.g asserton, assertoff, assertkill) once the assertion is out of power down period. <br />The assertions will remain disabled during power off period irrespective of any user assertion control system task.<br /></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) A new option &quot;-pa_enable=donttouchassertinbind&quot; has been introduced to keep the assertions unaffected  due to power down/power up in bind hierarchies. <br /></li>

<ul><li>QSIM-53662 - For certain signal widths the column width was being miscalculated which resulted in '*' being displayed in place of an actual value. The correct width is now being calculated.</li>
 <li>QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag. Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.</li>

<ul><li>QSIM-51616 - Intertial delay was not working properly for tranif/rtranif primitives with delay when the control/enable input had multiple transitions within the delay period.</li>
 <li>QSIM-52696 - In some cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating an array.size() constraint for a random dynamic array of real type. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  -  In some cases, vsim did not generate an error during elaboration when a non-existent class field was the first name in a dotted name.</li>

<ul><li>QSIM-53077 - In a protected type body, if there was a data member whose subtype involved another data member's value, then bad code, which would crash the simulator, would result.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the simulator.  This is a syntax error that is now detected.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54941 -  The presence of a package instantiation declaration within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.</li>
 <li>QSIM-50634 - (results)  In certain cases, optimization of clocked processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has been fixed.<div><br /></div></li>
