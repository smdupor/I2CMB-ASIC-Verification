   Key Information
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license
       servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
          + QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process
            of deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
            recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
            (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
            process starts with a warning if this option is used, which
            will become an error in later releases. The reason for this
            change is to remove the source ambiguities referenced by the
            compilation libraries. An encrypted compilation is a
            compilation of the post-encryption sources and must not retain
            any association with pre-encryption sources. This principle is
            reinforced by maintaining a two-step flow.

     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       other countries.
     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.7d

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of
       deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
       recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
       (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
       process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will
       become an error in later releases. The reason for this change is to
       remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation
       libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the
       post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with
       pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining
       a two-step flow.

   User Interface Compatibility
     * QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the
       Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some
       customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag.
       Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag
       now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-50634 - (results) In certain cases, optimization of clocked
       processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has
       been fixed.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * QSIM-53075 - (results) When passing a Verilog unpacked array to a
       VHDL array generic, values were mapped from the, Verilog value at
       the low index was mapped to the VHDL position with the left index.
       parameter int val[3:0] when passed to generic g1 :
       integer_array(3:0) would map val[0] => g1(3), val[1] => g1(2),
       val[2] => g1(1), val[3]=>g1(0). Now the values are passed like
       val[0] => g1[0], val[1] => g1(1), val[2] => g1(2), and val[3] =>
       g1(3).

   General Compatibility
     * QSIM-54154 - (results) Messages printed from VPI or PLI containing
       the strings "error" or "warning" were counted as tool error and
       warning and reported in stats output.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini
       files and deprecated warning message.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * QSIM-197 - (source, results) The following changes were made in the
       HDL package functions to align them with UPF LRM 3.1:
         1. Added support for singleton class object upfDesignT.
         2. Added field current_simstate on native UPF object upfPdSsObjT
            to fetch current simstate of power domains or supply sets.
         3. Type definition of upfHandleT has been changed from chandle to
            SV int.
       Now we strictly follow the LRM guideline, which says that the
       handles to properties and iterators may be reused and are not valid
       for comparison.
       10.7: In order to use HDL package functions in 10.7, User needs to
       make changes in the modelsim.ini file to point the mtiUPF to
       $MODEL_TECH/../upf_lib-3.1
     * QSIM-840 - (source, results) Instantaneously corrupting the value
       of LHS in delayed continuos assignment on power down.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The assertion control option
       "-pa_enable=forceasrtoffpwrdown" has been improved to honor user's
       assertion control system task(e.g asserton, assertoff, assertkill)
       once the assertion is out of power down period.
       The assertions will remain disabled during power off period
       irrespective of any user assertion control system task.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A new option
       "-pa_enable=donttouchassertinbind" has been introduced to keep the
       assertions unaffected due to power down/power up in bind
       hierarchies.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-24925 - Input-to-Input SDF INTERCONNECT delays are not
       annotated in optimized vsim run when there is not any driver on the
       high connection net.
     * QSIM-52009 - Fixed an issue where tool was crashing while printing
       capstats report with -du option. The issue was related to variable
       declarations inside fork..join.
     * QSIM-54154 - (results) Messages printed from VPI or PLI containing
       the strings "error" or "warning" were counted as tool error and
       warning and reported in stats output.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-53662 - For certain signal widths the column width was being
       miscalculated which resulted in '*' being displayed in place of an
       actual value. The correct width is now being calculated.
     * QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the
       Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some
       customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag.
       Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag
       now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.
     * QSIM-53899 - The font size in the Source window is incorrect under
       some newer X server configurations. This problem has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-51616 - Intertial delay was not working properly for
       tranif/rtranif primitives with delay when the control/enable input
       had multiple transitions within the delay period.
     * QSIM-52696 - In some cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating
       an array.size() constraint for a random dynamic array of real type.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases, vsim did not generate an error during
       elaboration when a non-existent class field was the first name in a
       dotted name.
     * QSIM-54192 - A "force -deposit" or $deposit on a net connected to
       tran primitives failed to take on the forced value.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-53077 - In a protected type body, if there was a data member
       whose subtype involved another data member's value, then bad code,
       which would crash the simulator, would result.
     * QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a
       locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect
       simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.
     * QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or
       default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved
       word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the
       simulator. This is a syntax error that is now detected.
     * QSIM-54941 - The presence of a package instantiation declaration
       within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the
       compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone
       design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line
       switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map
       clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in
       scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts
       that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.
     * QSIM-50634 - (results) In certain cases, optimization of clocked
       processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has
       been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-1380 - vopt crashes caused due to linking in
       libsystemc_gccXX.a into the intermediate shared library during the
       'sccom -linkshared' step has been fixed.
     * QSIM-51654 - scparse compilation failures with the nlohmann JSON
       c++ code has been fixed
     * QSIM-39643 - Fixed an incorrect flag setting for the pointer types
       that would cause an sccom (sccom-6165) merge error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-53075 - (results) When passing a Verilog unpacked array to a
       VHDL array generic, values were mapped from the, Verilog value at
       the low index was mapped to the VHDL position with the left index.
       parameter int val[3:0] when passed to generic g1 :
       integer_array(3:0) would map val[0] => g1(3), val[1] => g1(2),
       val[2] => g1(1), val[3]=>g1(0). Now the values are passed like
       val[0] => g1[0], val[1] => g1(1), val[2] => g1(2), and val[3] =>
       g1(3).
     * QSIM-53578 - When a write-protected library contained a Verilog DU
       made visible (as its equivalent ENTITY) by VHDL "use lib.all" in a
       VHDL design unit, if the VHDL design unit then contained an
       identifier that was the same as the name of this Verilog module, an
       error would occur as the equivalent ENTITY was being made. This
       error happened on Windows platforms only.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * VM-8513 - Fixed bug where "-exitcode" command-line option was not
       producing a non-zero exit code if the regression run had tests
       which timed out. The fix also includes producing a non-zero exit
       code in the event a test is killed (by the user) or dropped
       (possibly due to a VRM bug).
     * VM-10665 - Fixed bug where a runnable whose base attribute
       contained multiple runnable names separated by commas would result
       in an error when run through the RMDB sanity checker ("-checkrmdb"
       command-line option).
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed various issues in coverage extractor (vcover
       extract):
          + Escape backslashes in data (ie: escaped identifiers) when
            copying to JSON output
          + Non-trendable class scopes are no longer extracted
          + Missing (null) coverage values are not included in output
          + Testplan coverage is emitted only for testplan section scopes
     * VM-10936 - Fixed a bug in VRM where newline characters in a "tcl"
       parameter could cause errors with the "vrun -status" command and/or
       the VRM GUI.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.7d
     * QSIM-9086 - Earlier if an interface port in RTL is specified in upf
       connect_supply_net command to connect interface port with upf
       supply net then vopt was giving error because it was not supported.
       After this fix interface port in upf connect_supply_net is
       supported.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7d
     * QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini
       files and deprecated warning message.
     * QSIM-53134 - Added a SystemVerilog Constraint Solver extension.
       This extension is to enable the seeding of different module
       instances differently based on their hierarchical path names. The
       extension is off by default and can be enabled with vsim
       -svrandext=pathseed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Enhancements in 10.7d
     * QSIM-43418 - Designs that have a very large number of signals that
       are either multidimensional arrays or arrays whose elements are
       arrays or records will now load faster at simulation time.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Enhancements in 10.7d
     * QSIM-53671 - VHDL can now instantiate a Verilog module that has a
       multi-dimensional packed array-of-array-of-reg array port, when the
       actual connected to that port is a VHDL array port (as long as the
       number of scalar subelements matches).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.7d
     * VM-7029 - VRM testlist improvements:
          + If the first token on a non-comment testlist line is "include"
            and is followed by a second non-integer token, the second
            token is treated as a path name (absolute or relative to the
            directory where the parent file is located) and the referenced
            file is opened and recursively parsed as a nested testlist.
          + If the first (test name) token on two or more lines in a
            testlist are identical, the tests generated by those lines are
            combined into a single repeat list under that test name.

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.7d
     * QSIM-197 - (source, results) The following changes were made in the
       HDL package functions to align them with UPF LRM 3.1:
         1. Added support for singleton class object upfDesignT.
         2. Added field current_simstate on native UPF object upfPdSsObjT
            to fetch current simstate of power domains or supply sets.
         3. Type definition of upfHandleT has been changed from chandle to
            SV int.
       Now we strictly follow the LRM guideline, which says that the
       handles to properties and iterators may be reused and are not valid
       for comparison.
       10.7: In order to use HDL package functions in 10.7, User needs to
       make changes in the modelsim.ini file to point the mtiUPF to
       $MODEL_TECH/../upf_lib-3.1
     * QSIM-26929 - Under vopt option -pa_enable=resolvedsubnet, when
       there are multiple drivers and resolved nets in a connected network
       tool will collect all drivers of that network and drive all the
       resolved nets with common resolution function.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The assertion control option
       "-pa_enable=forceasrtoffpwrdown" has been improved to honor user's
       assertion control system task(e.g asserton, assertoff, assertkill)
       once the assertion is out of power down period.
       The assertions will remain disabled during power off period
       irrespective of any user assertion control system task.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A new option
       "-pa_enable=donttouchassertinbind" has been introduced to keep the
       assertions unaffected due to power down/power up in bind
       hierarchies.
     * QSIM-840 - (source, results) Instantaneously corrupting the value
       of LHS in delayed continuos assignment on power down.
