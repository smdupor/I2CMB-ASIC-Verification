   Release Announcements in 10.4g
     *
       [10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been
       discontinued.
       [10.4] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.
       However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4g

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt87563 - (results) In some cases the constraint solver would
       select different solutions when -classdebug was specified.
     * dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or
       inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.
     * dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set
       to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After the
       'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be
       made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.
     * dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them
       glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256,
       of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being
       driven by constants E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1; Questa PASim
       corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch
       -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being
       driven by constants.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * dvt90005 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the
       Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type and in "by file" mode
       did not work. It resulted in the warning message: # ** Warning:
       (vish-4036) The 'coverage exclude' command had no effect on
       some/all objects because # no matching coverage data was found.
       this has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be
       exclude with no warning.
     * dvt69668 - The UI can freeze unpredictably when the Coverage
       Analysis window is opened when invoking vsim. This issue has been
       resolved.
     * dvt90759 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the
       Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type did not work. It
       resulted in the 4014 warning message: "no matching object found".
       This has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be
       exclude with no warning.
     * dvt90591 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Statement,
       Branch, and Expression coverage panes, if filtereing (any
       combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied and some items
       of a multi-item line were not being displayed, the item numbers for
       the remaining displayed items could be incorrect. In addition, if
       the "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu was then applied to the
       incorrecly numbered displaye item, the exclude would be applied to
       the incorrect item. This has been fixed.
     * dvt88300 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Condition (and
       other) coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss,
       and excluded) was applied, some items would be displayed when they
       should be hidden by the filtering and vice versa. This has been
       fixed.
     * dvt101418 - The internal "ls" command in the vsim gui behaves
       incorrectly when no arguments are given. This command is only used
       on Windows, when there is no external "ls" command found. This
       issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * dvt87563 - (results) In some cases the constraint solver would
       select different solutions when -classdebug was specified.
     * dvt91297 - A vector with bits connected to different instances of
       an instance array instantiation was connected improperly in some
       unusual cases.
     * dvt87810 - Vopt would give errors like this:
       ** Error: test.sv(17): (vopt-2132) Instance 'dut' has a
       non-optimizable form of recursive instantiation.
       with recursively instantiated modules within generate loops and
       conditions.
     * dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or
       inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.
     * dvt92487 - Fix vsim elaboration crash related to concatenations
       connected to ports of inlined module instances.
     * dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set
       to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After the
       'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be
       made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.
     * dvt93510 - Fixed a vlog crash when virtual interface specialization
       is used with empty parameter. Example:- virtual intf #(.param())
     * [nodvtid] - vlog's -E output might incorrectly emit
       "`pragmaprotect" rather than "`pragma" whitespace "protect".
     * dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an
       array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an
       internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic
       arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100885 - In some rare cases, randomize() will generate a
       spurious (vsim-7020) error "Illegal attempt to resize random
       dynamic array" when randomizing a dynamic array with
       -solvefaildebug enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt100802 - Fixed compiler (vopt/vlog) crashes when DPI function
       calls are used in SystemVerilog constraints.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * dvt90896 - Vcom could crash when trying to report an invalid field
       of a record if the prefix of the selected name was an index on an
       array access type.
     * dvt91137 - A generic of a record type might receive an incorrect
       actual value when the actual was a function call and there existed
       another different function call actual for a different formal.
     * dvt91501 - For some specific cases of signal assignment statement,
       signal was not getting updated properly. This has been fixed.
     * dvt92589 - Definition of a very large constant array within a
       package could cause elaboration of the package to exhaust all
       available stack space, causing the simulator to crash. Recompiling
       the package with -O0 or -O1 is a temporary measure to prevent the
       crash.
     * dvt92840 - Access to a shared variable through an interface package
       could cause the elaboration phase of the simulator to crash.
     * dvt93089 - A call to a shared variable's method from within a
       subprogram of an uninstantiated package could cause the simulator
       to crash.
     * dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256,
       of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.
     * dvt81635 - For certain specific cases, vsim issues a fatal error
       while trying to optimize functions with assertion statements.This
       has been fixed.
     * dvt94049 - The compiler incorrectly reported the following error
       when encountering an alias of an operator function instance:
** Error: Alias with operator symbol designator must denote a function.

       The compiler also incorrectly generated code for newly-defined
       operator functions with generic-typed parameters.
     * dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL
       package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design
       unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.
     * dvt97593 - Direct instantiation of an entity with a package
       instantiation in one of the generic map associations could cause
       incorrect code to be generated by the compiler, possibly leading to
       a loading failure message from the simulator.
     * dvt101580 - Certain styles of continuous selected signal assignment
       statements with zero delay would not execute properly when
       optimized, either in an optimized design or a design compiled with
       the PE version of the product.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * dvt90588 - vsim's memory usage keeps on increasing after a
       multi-clock assertion gets disabled.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * [nodvtid] - Minor fixes to VRM automatic email function: (a) the
       EMAIL_RECIPIENTS, EMAIL_SECTIONS, and EMAIL_SERVERS parameters may
       now contain space/comma-separated lists of strings, and (b) the
       EMAIL_SERVERS parameter is properly processed when multiple server
       names are provided.
     * dvt94450 - Fixed crash in VRM GUI when expanding Runnable tree with
       at least one repeat override specified.
     * dvt94326 - In the VRM GUI, the "Suspend/Terminate Selected Jobs"
       menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is running.
       Likewise, the "Resume Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none
       of the selected jobs is suspended.
     * dvt94708 - The Timeout spinners on the Runtime tab of the VRM
       Congifuration Edit dialog were too narrow to display timeout values
       consisting of four or more digits.
     * dvt93999 - Fixed problem where known-path parameters whose values
       were not absolute paths were not being expanded by the C/SQL API.
       Fixed error in TCL API path expansion when TCL-special characters
       were included in the path. Fixed TCL error in two path-expansion
       error messages.
     * dvt95137 - Fixed problem with the way non-standard normalizetime
       values (generally from transform rules) are displayed in the
       Results Analysis window.
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt96255 - Fixed TCL error when using "vrun -kill" option to kill a
       regression test in testname mode.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.4g
     * dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being
       driven by constants E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1; Questa PASim
       corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch
       -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being
       driven by constants.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.4g
     * dvt90505 - The Files View collapses the tree whenever there is an
       update to the current context or run state. The view will now
       remain expanded and the selection and filters will remain in place
       during any updates.
     * dvt91003 - The Coverage Report dialog box now has an option for the
       user to select how the report is displayed. The options are
       "notepad", "source viewer", "none", or "user-defined editor". The
       user-defined editor choice uses the EDITOR environment variable, or
       the PrefMain(Editor) preference variable to determine which editor
       to invoke. Once a choice is made, it will be persistent across
       sessions.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.4g
     * dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them
       glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4g
     * dvt89824 - Two routines have been added to the UCDB API.
/*
 * ucdb_GetTestIndex()
 *
 * Return the index value for test record.
 * Return -1 if an error occurs.
 */
int
ucdb_GetTestIndex(ucdbT db, ucdbTestT test);

/*
 * ucdb_GetIthTest()
 *
 * Return the test record having the indicated index value.
 * Return NULL if an error occurs.
 */
ucdbTestT
ucdb_GetIthTest(ucdbT db, int index);

     * [nodvtid] - Tests listed in a VRM testlist file now support the
       "%n" and "%s" tokens in parameter overrides.
     * [nodvtid] - The "-debug" option on the vrun command may now
       optionally take the form "-debug=" where "flags" is a
       comma-separated list of debug flags. The only debug flag supported
       currently is "usertcl" which will cause a message to be emitted
       before and after any usertcl procedure is executed. The legacy
       "-debug" option behaves as before.
     * [nodvtid] - VRM now supports modifying the mimetype and encoding of
       emails sent from within vrun by modifying certain pre-defined
       parameters in the RMDB.
