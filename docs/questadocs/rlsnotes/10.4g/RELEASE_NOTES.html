[10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been discontinued.<br>
[10.4] Licensing Information
<p>There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.

<p>However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and older,
please note the following:

<ul><li>Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The 
vendor daemons and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will 
be FLEXnet version 11.11.1.1.
<li>For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
<li>If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
</ul><br>
[10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.<br>
[10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology) library, sources and documentation have been updated to version 2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.<br>
[10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.<br>
[10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.1] Support for GCC versions gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.<br>
[10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.<br>

 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

<ul><li>dvt87563 - (results) In some cases the constraint solver would select different solutions when -classdebug was specified.</li>
 <li>dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.</li>
 <li>dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After 
the 'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.</li>
 <li>dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256, of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.</li>
 <li>dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read, correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being driven by constants 
E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1;
Questa PASim corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being driven by constants.

</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not supported.
Such an action would break the integrity of the bin counts in the database.
An error message is issued when an attempt is made to delete a test while using
'coverage edit -delete -test < test name >'.</li>

<ul><li>dvt90005 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the Code Coverage Analysis window
using FSM type and in "by file" mode did not work.  It resulted in the warning message:
# ** Warning: (vish-4036) The 'coverage exclude' command had no effect on some/all objects because
# no matching coverage data was found.

this has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be exclude with no warning.
</li>
 <li>dvt69668 - The UI can freeze unpredictably when the Coverage Analysis window is opened when invoking vsim.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt90759 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type did not work. It resulted in the 4014 warning message: "no matching object found".  This has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be exclude with no warning. </li>
 <li>dvt90591 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Statement, Branch, and Expression coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied and some items of a multi-item line were not being displayed, the item numbers for the remaining displayed items could be incorrect.   In addition, if the "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu was then applied to the incorrecly numbered displaye item, the exclude would be applied to the incorrect item.  This has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt88300 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Condition (and other) coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied, some items would be displayed when they should be hidden by the filtering and vice versa.  This has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt101418 - The internal "ls" command in the vsim gui behaves incorrectly when no arguments are given.  This command is only used on Windows, when there is no external "ls" command found.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

<ul><li>dvt87563 - (results) In some cases the constraint solver would select different solutions when -classdebug was specified.</li>
 <li>dvt91297 - A vector with bits connected to different instances of an instance array instantiation was connected improperly in some unusual cases.</li>
 <li>dvt87810 - Vopt would give errors like this:<br><code>
** Error: test.sv(17): (vopt-2132) Instance 'dut' has a non-optimizable form of recursive instantiation.</code><br>
with recursively instantiated modules within generate loops and conditions.</li>
 <li>dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.</li>
 <li>dvt92487 - Fix vsim elaboration crash related to concatenations connected to ports of inlined module instances.</li>
 <li>dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After 
the 'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.</li>
 <li>dvt93510 - Fixed a vlog crash when virtual interface specialization is used with empty parameter.
Example:- virtual intf #(.param())</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - vlog's -E output might incorrectly emit "`pragmaprotect" rather than "`pragma" whitespace "protect".</li>
 <li>dvt100404 - In some rare cases, a constraint involving an array.sum() constraint having a 'with' clause would trigger an internal error during randomize() for multi-dimensional dynamic arrays/queues. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt100885 - In some rare cases, randomize() will generate a spurious (vsim-7020) error "Illegal attempt to resize random dynamic array" when randomizing a dynamic array with -solvefaildebug enabled. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt100802 - Fixed compiler (vopt/vlog) crashes when DPI function calls are used in SystemVerilog constraints.</li>

<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4g</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt90896 - Vcom could crash when trying to report an invalid field of a record if the prefix of the selected name was an index on an array access type.</li>
 <li>dvt91137 - A generic of a record type might receive an incorrect actual value when the actual was a function call and there existed another different function call actual for a different formal.</li>
 <li>dvt91501 - For some specific cases of signal assignment statement, signal was not getting updated properly. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt92589 - Definition of a very large constant array within a package could cause elaboration of the package to exhaust all available stack space, causing the simulator to crash. Recompiling the package with -O0 or -O1 is a temporary measure to prevent the crash.</li>
 <li>dvt92840 - Access to a shared variable through an interface package could cause the elaboration phase of the simulator to crash.</li>
 <li>dvt93089 - A call to a shared variable's method from within a subprogram of an uninstantiated package could cause the simulator to crash.</li>
 <li>dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256, of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.</li>
 <li>dvt81635 - For certain specific cases, vsim issues a fatal error while trying to optimize functions with assertion statements.This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt94049 - The compiler incorrectly reported the following error when encountering an alias of an operator function instance:
<pre>
** Error: Alias with operator symbol designator must denote a function.
</pre>
The compiler also incorrectly generated code for newly-defined operator functions with generic-typed parameters.</li>
 <li>dvt98225 - (results) In certain conditions involving a VHDL package, vopt issued an incorrect "(vopt-3369) Top-level design unit specified more than once." error. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt97593 - Direct instantiation of an entity with a package instantiation in one of the generic map associations could cause incorrect code to be generated by the compiler, possibly leading to a loading failure message from the simulator.</li>
 <li>dvt101580 - Certain styles of continuous selected signal assignment statements with zero delay would not execute properly when optimized, either in an optimized design or a design compiled with the PE version of the product.</li>

 <li>dvt94450 - Fixed crash in VRM GUI when expanding Runnable tree with at least one repeat override specified.</li>
 <li>dvt94326 - In the VRM GUI, the "Suspend/Terminate Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is running. Likewise, the "Resume Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is suspended.</li>
 <li>dvt94708 - The Timeout spinners on the Runtime tab of the VRM Congifuration Edit dialog were too narrow to display timeout values consisting of four or more digits.</li>
 <li>dvt93999 - Fixed problem where known-path parameters whose values were not absolute paths were not being expanded by the C/SQL API. Fixed error in TCL API path expansion when TCL-special characters were included in the path. Fixed TCL error in two path-expansion error messages.</li>
 <li>dvt95137 - Fixed problem with the way non-standard normalizetime values (generally from transform rules) are displayed in the Results Analysis window.</li>
 <li>dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not supported.
Such an action would break the integrity of the bin counts in the database.
