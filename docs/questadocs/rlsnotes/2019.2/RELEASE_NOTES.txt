   Key Information
     * The Register Assistant version included within this release has
       been upgraded to RUVM/2019.2.
       RUVM/2019.2 is a native 64bit application.
     * There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1 or 2019.2.
       However, if you are migrating to 2019.2 from a release like 10.6
       and older, please note that release 2019.2 uses FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   Release Announcements in 2019.2
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge
       Article MG596568 on SupportNet.
       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have
       discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to
       support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until
       their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid
       2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 2019.2

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   User Interface Compatibility
     * QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the
       Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some
       customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag.
       Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag
       now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-54037 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2().
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to
       the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving
       constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior
       related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been
       corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also
       improved.
     * QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving "unique"
       constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions)
       for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios
       involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no
       solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55627 - (results) In some rare cases involving equality
       constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the
       constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no
       solutions when "-solvefaildebug=2" is specified. The diagnostic
       output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a
       fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-50634 - (results) In certain cases, optimization of clocked
       processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55137 - (results) In certain cases, vopt was crashing during
       optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * VISU-2069 - (results) This fixes a problem of not logging internal
       signals of SV modules when instantiated inside a VHDL block
       statement into qwavedb.

   General Compatibility
     * QSIM-54154 - (results) Messages printed from VPI or PLI containing
       the strings "error" or "warning" were counted as tool error and
       warning and reported in stats output.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * QSIM-54154 - (results) Messages printed from VPI or PLI containing
       the strings "error" or "warning" were counted as tool error and
       warning and reported in stats output.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the
       Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some
       customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag.
       Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag
       now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.
     * QSIM-53899 - The font size in the Source window is incorrect under
       some newer X server configurations. This problem has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases, vsim did not generate an error during
       elaboration when a non-existent class field was the first name in a
       dotted name.
     * QSIM-54192 - A "force -deposit" or $deposit on a net connected to
       tran primitives failed to take on the forced value.
     * QSIM-36267 - Vsim would sometimes leak memory when SystemVerilog
       strings were used in constant functions defined in a package.
     * QSIM-29891 - In some cases, invoking randomize() via a dotted path
       containing a function call (e.g. " r.get_field().randomize() with
       {...}") would cause an error or crash during compilation. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-53856 - Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real'
       type on the RHS (e.g. "myvar inside { array_of_real }") would
       trigger an internal error "==? operator invalid for REAL". This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54037 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2().
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54298 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause simulation
       to crash when evaluating a scenario with the BDD solve engine. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to
       the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving
       constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior
       related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been
       corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also
       improved.
     * QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving "unique"
       constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions)
       for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios
       involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no
       solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55627 - (results) In some rare cases involving equality
       constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-56318 - In some rare cases, an internal error would occur
       during randomize() indicating an error in slvACTNodeMap. This issue
       has been fixed.
     * QSIM-56429 - In some rare cases, certain kinds of ternary
       constraint expressions would trigger an internal error during
       randomize(). This issue has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a
       locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect
       simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.
     * QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or
       default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved
       word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the
       simulator. This is a syntax error that is now detected.
     * QSIM-54941 - The presence of a package instantiation declaration
       within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the
       compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone
       design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line
       switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map
       clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in
       scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts
       that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.
     * QSIM-50634 - (results) In certain cases, optimization of clocked
       processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has
       been fixed.
     * QSIM-55460 - A VHDL 2008 IF-GENERATE with ELSIF-GENERATE
       alternative block(s) could cause a simulator crash if vopt could
       determine that a condition was FALSE.
     * QSIM-55137 - (results) In certain cases, vopt was crashing during
       optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed.
     * QSIM-55531 - If a component or an entity contains a generic whose
       type is dependent on another generic of the component or entity.
       Code generation in vcom or vopt could fail.
     * QSIM-56373 - A VHDL design unit whose source text is in 2 or more
       files is not supported. An error will be issued if such a situation
       is detected.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * QSIM-39643 - Fixed an incorrect flag setting for the pointer types
       that would cause an sccom (sccom-6165) merge error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * QSIM-53578 - When a write-protected library contained a Verilog DU
       made visible (as its equivalent ENTITY) by VHDL "use lib.all" in a
       VHDL design unit, if the VHDL design unit then contained an
       identifier that was the same as the name of this Verilog module, an
       error would occur as the equivalent ENTITY was being made. This
       error happened on Windows platforms only.
     * VISU-2069 - (results) This fixes a problem of not logging internal
       signals of SV modules when instantiated inside a VHDL block
       statement into qwavedb.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 2019.2
     * VM-10936 - Fixed a bug in VRM where newline characters in a "tcl"
       parameter could cause errors with the "vrun -status" command and/or
       the VRM GUI.
     * VM-10952 - Fixed issue with internal testlist parser where multiple
       test lines with the same name and a repeat count of one would
       result in a "duplicate entry" error when the RMDB was expanded.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bogus error message emitted when VRM (vrun)
       doesn't detect the proper license.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 2019.2
     * QSIM-53134 - Added a SystemVerilog Constraint Solver extension.
       This extension is to enable the seeding of different module
       instances differently based on their hierarchical path names. The
       extension is off by default and can be enabled with vsim
       -svrandext=pathseed.
     * QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the
       constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no
       solutions when "-solvefaildebug=2" is specified. The diagnostic
       output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a
       fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.
     * QSIM-54662 - Constraint expressions involving multiplication of
       'real' type operands are now supported during randomize() when the
       "realrand" SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default).
       Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a
       SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.
