<p /><a name="keyinfo"></a><font size="5"><b>Key Information</b></font>
<ul><li> The Register Assistant version included within this release has been upgraded to RUVM/2019.2.<br /><br />RUVM/2019.2 is a native  64bit application.</li>
 <li><p>
There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1 or 2019.2. However, if you are migrating to 2019.2 from a release like 10.6 and older, please note that release 2019.2 uses FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

</p><p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

</p><p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

</p><p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
</p><ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 </li><li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 </li><li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 </li><li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
</li></ul></li>
 <li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<ul><li>QSIM-54037 - (results)  In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also improved.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving &quot;unique&quot; constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.</li>

<ul><li>[nodvtid]  -  In some cases, vsim did not generate an error during elaboration when a non-existent class field was the first name in a dotted name.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54192 -  A &quot;force -deposit&quot; or $deposit on a net connected to tran primitives failed to take on the forced value.</li>
 <li>QSIM-36267 -  Vsim would sometimes leak memory when SystemVerilog strings were used in constant functions defined in a package.</li>
 <li>QSIM-29891 -  In some cases, invoking randomize() via a dotted path containing a function call (e.g. &quot; r.get_field().randomize() with {...}&quot;) would cause an error or crash during compilation. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-53856 -  Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real' type on the RHS (e.g. &quot;myvar inside { array_of_real }&quot;) would trigger an internal error &quot;==? operator invalid for REAL&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54037 - (results)  In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54298 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would cause simulation to crash when evaluating a scenario with the BDD solve engine. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving constraints with random array indices.

<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 2019.2</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the simulator.  This is a syntax error that is now detected.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54941 -  The presence of a package instantiation declaration within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.</li>
 <li>QSIM-50634 - (results)  In certain cases, optimization of clocked processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has been fixed.<div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-55460 - A VHDL 2008 IF-GENERATE with ELSIF-GENERATE alternative block(s) could cause a simulator crash if vopt could determine that a condition was FALSE.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-55137 - (results)  In certain cases, vopt was crashing during optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed. <div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-55531 -  If a component or an entity contains a generic whose type is dependent on another generic of the component or entity. Code generation in vcom or vopt could fail.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56373 - A VHDL design unit whose source text is in 2 or more files is not supported.  An error will be issued if such a situation is detected.<br /><br /></li>

<p /><a name="systemcdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemC Defects Repaired in 2019.2</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-39643 - Fixed an incorrect flag setting for the pointer types that would cause an sccom (sccom-6165) merge error. </li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="mixeddefects"></a><font size="4"><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 2019.2</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-53578 - When a write-protected library contained a Verilog DU made visible (as its equivalent ENTITY) by VHDL &quot;use lib.all&quot; in a VHDL design unit, if the VHDL design unit then contained an identifier that was the same as the name of this Verilog module, an error would occur as the equivalent ENTITY was being made.  This error happened on Windows platforms only.<br /></li>

<p /><a name="vmdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>Verification Management Defects Repaired in 2019.2</b></font>
<ul><li>VM-10936 - Fixed a bug in VRM where newline characters in a &quot;tcl&quot; parameter could cause errors with the &quot;vrun -status&quot; command and/or the VRM GUI.<br /></li>
 <li>VM-10952 - Fixed issue with internal testlist parser where multiple test lines with the same name and a repeat count of one would result in a &quot;duplicate entry&quot; error when the RMDB was expanded.<br /></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Fixed bogus error message emitted when VRM (vrun) doesn't detect the proper license.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="systemverilogenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Enhancements in 2019.2</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-53134 -  Added a SystemVerilog Constraint Solver extension. This extension is to enable the seeding of different module instances differently based on their hierarchical path names. The extension is off by default and can be enabled with vsim -svrandext=pathseed.<br />   </li>
 <li>QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no solutions when &quot;-solvefaildebug=2&quot; is specified. The diagnostic output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.<br /><br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54662 - Constraint expressions involving multiplication of 'real' type operands are now supported during randomize() when the &quot;realrand&quot; SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default). Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.</li>
