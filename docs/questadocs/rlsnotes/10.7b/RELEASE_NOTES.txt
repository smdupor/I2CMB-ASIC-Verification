   Key Information
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license
       servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.7b

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&&
       and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV
       HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions.
       Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.
     * dvt110034 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt
       -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an
       IfElse constraint with constant condition.
       By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is
       triggered.
       vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to
       the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if
       solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
       When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant,
       a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.

     * dvt109786 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt107051 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle
       was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all
       shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG
       (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results
       of a call to the shuffle method. In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG
       selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
       +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
       -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle
       method The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim. For
       backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled
       (-thrdrngshfl)
     * dvt110375 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are
       present.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt108867 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked processes,
       forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation results. This
       has been fixed now.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt108910 - (source) Added a suppressible error (9032) for cases -
       when ack port is already driven in HDL and because of which tool
       will not dump any drivers for the ack port. Earlier this
       information was dumped in a report file. This change will not
       impact the results but users might have to suppress this error if
       issued.
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) Change in behavior of Balloon-style
       level sensitive retention protocol : Presently tool retention
       behavior is to transfer the retained value on the register at the
       leading edge of the restore event (if the restore_condition is
       high). This has been changed to make the behavior LRM compliant. In
       the new behavior, the tool will transfer the retained value on the
       register at the trailing edge of the restore_event (when
       restore_condition is high). User can get this new behavior using
       the option -pa_enable=trailingedgerestore.
     * dvt109460 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption
       of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those
       always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are
       non-synthesizable. Users will be notified with a warning message
       (vopt-9031) whenever such blocks are ignored. To enable corruption
       for such always blocks use the vopt option
       -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.
     * dvt110260 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated - 1- parse the
       liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to
       option -pa_libertyfiles 2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is
       provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files,
       then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file

   General Compatibility
     * dvt94468 - (results) When using vsim -batch mode, the transcript
       (stdout) output could contain NUL and CR characters that are
       otherwise filtered out when using other vsim modes. The transcript
       output in -batch mode now matches the output when using -c or -i
       modes in this regard.

   Qwave logging Compatibility
     * dvt109564 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in
       the Qwave wavefile. Now they are.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * dvt84893 - The simulation timescale is incorrect in some
       circumstances when running in -batch mode.
     * dvt94468 - (results) When using vsim -batch mode, the transcript
       (stdout) output could contain NUL and CR characters that are
       otherwise filtered out when using other vsim modes. The transcript
       output in -batch mode now matches the output when using -c or -i
       modes in this regard.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * dvt109672 - The vsim GUI crashes when displaying certain comments
       in VHDL source code. This issue has been resolved.
     * [nodvtid] - Enabled class instance window in view mode
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * dvt109786 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt110832 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger an
       internal error related to an interaction between random dynamic
       arrays and pre_randomize. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt107051 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle
       was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all
       shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG
       (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results
       of a call to the shuffle method. In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG
       selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
       +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
       -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle
       method The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim. For
       backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled
       (-thrdrngshfl)
     * dvt110375 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are
       present.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&&
       and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV
       HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions.
       Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * dvt109476 - The vcom compiler "-just" and "-skip" options now allow
       the specification 'x', which means VHDL 2008 "context"
       declarations.
     * dvt108867 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked processes,
       forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation results. This
       has been fixed now.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM where FetchEventUcdbs build-in utility
       procedure could return incorrect paths.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * dvt109460 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption
       of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those
       always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are
       non-synthesizable. Users will be notified with a warning message
       (vopt-9031) whenever such blocks are ignored. To enable corruption
       for such always blocks use the vopt option
       -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.
     * dvt110260 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated - 1- parse the
       liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to
       option -pa_libertyfiles 2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is
       provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files,
       then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Qwave logging Defects Repaired in 10.7b
     * dvt109564 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in
       the Qwave wavefile. Now they are.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.7b
     * [nodvtid] - -stats=perf+verbose will now print additional section
       about the machine and OS environment, where executable is run. This
       is available in all executables, which support -stats option.

     Host: mach1.mentorg.com (SGE grid)
       OS: CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7b
     * dvt110034 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt
       -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an
       IfElse constraint with constant condition.
       By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is
       triggered.
       vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to
       the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if
       solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
       When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant,
       a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.

     * dvt110190 - Added a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension to enable "strict" random stability in the solver.
       "Strict" random stability guarantees that two instances of the same
       class, having the same randstate, will generate the same
       randomize() results -- regardless of the order in which the
       randomize() calls are made and independent of any randomize() calls
       that are made before them. Enable "strict" random stability with
       the vsim command line option "-svrandext=+strictstab". Enabling
       "strict" random stability can negatively impact randomize()
       performance for some scenarios. This extension is disabled by
       default.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.7b
     * dvt108910 - (source) Added a suppressible error (9032) for cases -
       when ack port is already driven in HDL and because of which tool
       will not dump any drivers for the ack port. Earlier this
       information was dumped in a report file. This change will not
       impact the results but users might have to suppress this error if
       issued.
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) Change in behavior of Balloon-style
       level sensitive retention protocol : Presently tool retention
       behavior is to transfer the retained value on the register at the
       leading edge of the restore event (if the restore_condition is
       high). This has been changed to make the behavior LRM compliant. In
       the new behavior, the tool will transfer the retained value on the
       register at the trailing edge of the restore_event (when
       restore_condition is high). User can get this new behavior using
       the option -pa_enable=trailingedgerestore.
