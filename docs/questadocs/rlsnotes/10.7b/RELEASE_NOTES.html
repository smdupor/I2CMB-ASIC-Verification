<ul><li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li><p>
This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 <li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 <li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 <li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&& and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions. Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.</li>
 <li>dvt110034 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an IfElse constraint with constant condition. 
<br>
By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is triggered.
<br>
vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
<br>
When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant, a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.

<pre>
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt109786 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize() for the same class type and randstate would generate different results. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt107051 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results of a call to the shuffle method.
In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
  +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
  -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle method
The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim.
For backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled (-thrdrngshfl)
</li>
 <li>dvt110375 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are present.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt108867 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked processes, forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation results. This has been fixed now.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt108910 - (source) Added a suppressible error (9032) for cases  - when ack port is already driven in HDL and because of which tool will not dump any drivers for the ack port. Earlier this information was dumped in a report file. This change will not impact the results but users might have to suppress this error if issued.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source, results) Change in behavior of Balloon-style level sensitive retention protocol :
Presently tool retention behavior is to transfer the retained value on the register at the leading edge of the restore event (if the restore_condition is high). This has been changed to make the behavior LRM compliant. In the new behavior, the tool will transfer the retained value on the register at the trailing edge of the restore_event (when restore_condition is high). 
User can get this new behavior using the option -pa_enable=trailingedgerestore.</li>
 <li>dvt109460 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are non-synthesizable. Users will be notified with a warning message (vopt-9031) whenever such blocks are ignored. To enable corruption for such always blocks use the vopt option -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.</li>
 <li>dvt110260 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated -  
1- parse the liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to option -pa_libertyfiles
2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files, then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt94468 - (results) When using vsim -batch mode, the transcript (stdout) output could contain NUL and CR characters that are otherwise filtered out when using other vsim modes.  The transcript output in -batch mode now matches the output when using -c or -i modes in this regard.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Qwave logging  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt109564 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in the Qwave wavefile.  Now they are.</li>

 <li>dvt110190 - Added a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension to enable "strict" random stability in the solver. "Strict" random stability guarantees that two instances of the same class, having the same randstate, will generate the same randomize() results -- regardless of the order in which the randomize() calls are made and independent of any randomize() calls that are made before them. Enable "strict" random stability with the vsim command line option "-svrandext=+strictstab". Enabling "strict" random stability can negatively impact randomize() performance for some scenarios.
