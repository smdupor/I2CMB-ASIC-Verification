   Key Information
     * The vlog -wireasinterconnect option is deprecated due to
       performance issues, and a warning message is issued to that effect
       when used. The vopt -rnmautointeconnect option is preferred because
       it takes advantage of the vopt analysis to more selectively convert
       wires to interconnect. Only wires connected upwards from
       real/wreal/nettype/interconnect ports are converted.

   Release Announcements in 10.6e
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5
            x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release,
            gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for
            SystemC have been discontinued.
          + Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
            limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
          + Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
            plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
            documentation are fully functional.
            Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
            result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
            current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF
            manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web
            browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this
            behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is
            compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
            page-oriented layout.
            Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between
            topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference
            material, and other related technical content.

          + (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
            deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
            deprecation process:
               o The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a
                 deprecation suppressible error message.
               o In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will
                 not be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with
                 error message.
               o Customer scripts using this switch will have to be
                 changed. This legacy switch forces incremental mode
                 (pre-6.0 behavior) which is sub-optimal, and it is no
                 longer maintained.
               o We regularly review our OS/Platform support for
                 Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification
                 products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
                 That process normally takes a number of years from
                 decision to action. Customer notifications are typically
                 only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and
                 Install Guide.
                 We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year
                 from now. We began notifications of this change back in
                 January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
                 As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are
                 discontinued, replacement hardware can only support
                 Windows 10. So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP
                 & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity and ability to
                 support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
                 Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to
                 discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only
                 Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10. However
                 we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6
                 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL
                 - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
                 Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6e
       SystemVerilog Compatibility

     * [nodvtid] - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&&
       and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV
       HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions.
       Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.
     * dvt110034 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt
       -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an
       IfElse constraint with constant condition.
       By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is
       triggered.
       vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to
       the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if
       solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
       When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant,
       a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.

     * dvt103663 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function
       calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a
       $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant
       (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a
       fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result
       of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver
       during a randomize call.
     * dvt109786 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt107051 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle
       was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all
       shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG
       (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results
       of a call to the shuffle method. In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG
       selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
       +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
       -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle
       method The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim. For
       backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled
       (-thrdrngshfl)
     * dvt110375 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are
       present.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt108867 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked processes,
       forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation results. This
       has been fixed now.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt109460 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption
       of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those
       always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are
       non-synthesizable. To enable corruption for such always blocks use
       the vopt option -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.
     * dvt110260 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated - 1- parse the
       liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to
       option -pa_libertyfiles 2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is
       provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files,
       then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file

   General Compatibility
     * dvt94468 - (results) When using vsim -batch mode, the transcript
       (stdout) output could contain NUL and CR characters that are
       otherwise filtered out when using other vsim modes. The transcript
       output in -batch mode now matches the output when using -c or -i
       modes in this regard.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
       Qwave logging Compatibility

     * dvt109564 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in
       the Qwave wavefile. Now they are.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * dvt84893 - The simulation timescale is incorrect in some
       circumstances when running in -batch mode.
     * dvt94468 - (results) When using vsim -batch mode, the transcript
       (stdout) output could contain NUL and CR characters that are
       otherwise filtered out when using other vsim modes. The transcript
       output in -batch mode now matches the output when using -c or -i
       modes in this regard.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * dvt108473 - From the Message Viewer, when opening the source file
       referenced in a message, if the file cannot be found, a dialog box
       will pop up, requesting the user to select the location of the
       file.
     * dvt106889 - "vmap" fails silently when there is a leftover lock
       file. Now it will report a warning 5 times, 5 seconds apart, before
       giving up and returning an error status.
     * dvt109082 - Repaired GUI crash when associative arrays are present
       in automatic functions.
     * dvt109387 - The Coverage HTML Report dialog box sometimes fails
       with an "# ** Error: (vsim-4003) Invalid option '-code '." message.
       This issue has been repaired.
     * dvt109672 - The vsim GUI crashes when displaying certain comments
       in VHDL source code. This issue has been resolved.
     * [nodvtid] - Enabled class instance window in view mode
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * dvt103663 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function
       calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a
       $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant
       (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a
       fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result
       of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver
       during a randomize call.
     * dvt109061 - In some rare cases, randomize() would fail with the
       following spurious error message: "Invalid random variable in index
       expression for constraint" -- even in cases where an index
       expression only referred to constant (non-random) variables. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt109786 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt110832 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger an
       internal error related to an interaction between random dynamic
       arrays and pre_randomize. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt107051 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle
       was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all
       shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG
       (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results
       of a call to the shuffle method. In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG
       selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
       +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
       -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle
       method The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim. For
       backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled
       (-thrdrngshfl)
     * dvt110375 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are

       and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV
       HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions.
       Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * dvt107650 - Reference to a package constant defined within a
       package instance that is itself defined within a simple package
       could cause the compiler to produce an internal error.
     * dvt108324 - The compiler could crash when encountering a composite
       assignment, where the left-hand side contains a variable whose type
       is an interface type.
     * dvt109476 - The vcom compiler "-just" and "-skip" options now allow
       the specification 'x', which means VHDL 2008 "context"
       declarations.
     * dvt108867 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked processes,
       forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation results. This
       has been fixed now.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM where FetchEventUcdbs build-in utility
       procedure could return incorrect paths.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug where "-inputsfile" option to "triage
       passfail" command wasn't being recognized.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * dvt109460 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption
       of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those
       always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are
       non-synthesizable. To enable corruption for such always blocks use
       the vopt option -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.
     * dvt110260 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated - 1- parse the
       liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to
       option -pa_libertyfiles 2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is
       provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files,
       then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Qwave logging Defects Repaired in 10.6e
     * dvt109564 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in
       the Qwave wavefile. Now they are.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.6e
     * [nodvtid] - -stats=perf+verbose will now print additional section
       about the machine and OS environment, where executable is run. This
       is available in all executables, which support -stats option.
 Machine Details
     Host: mach1.mentorg.com (SGE grid)
       OS: CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.6e
     * dvt109197 - Added PrefWave(LineWidth) preference define the width
       of waveform lines. The default is '1'. Defining larger widths are
       useful for high density monitors where a single pixel wide line is
       too narrow to see clearly.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.6e
     * dvt110034 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt
       -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an
       IfElse constraint with constant condition.
       By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is
       triggered.
       vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to
       the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if
       solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
       When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant,
       a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.

     * dvt110190 - Added a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension to enable "strict" random stability in the solver.
       "Strict" random stability guarantees that two instances of the same
       class, having the same randstate, will generate the same
       randomize() results -- regardless of the order in which the
       randomize() calls are made and independent of any randomize() calls
       that are made before them. Enable "strict" random stability with
       the vsim command line option "-svrandext=+strictstab". Enabling
       "strict" random stability can negatively impact randomize()
       performance for some scenarios. This extension is disabled by
       default.
