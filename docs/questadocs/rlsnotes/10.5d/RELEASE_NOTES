   Key Information
     * (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in
       10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be
       incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage.
       The required setup change is one of the followings:
       1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype
       declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
       OR
       2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to
       manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines.
       DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
       The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the
       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

     * dvt95794 - Added modelsim.ini variable "AllowCheckpointCpp", a
       companion variable for existing vsim -allowcheckpointcpp switch
   -allowcheckpointcpp 1|0 Turn on/off the support for checkpointing foreign C++
 libraries.
                           Must be used in the vsim session where a checkpoint i
s created.

; Enable the support for checkpointing foreign C++ libraries.
; The valid arguments are: 1 and 0.
;     1 : turn on the support
;     0 : turn off the support (default)
; This option is not supported on the Windows platforms.
;
; AllowCheckpointCpp = 1

   Release Announcements in 10.5d
     * In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise
       Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be
       dropped.
     * Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + 10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual
            Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the
            executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be
            linked in with "msvcr120.dll". If you have SystemC or
            PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any
            gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be
            re-compiled with 10.5. Windows platform compiler details is as
            follows:
               o "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for
                 download on a request basis.
                 Compiler versions have not been changed compared to
                 previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more
                 details.
               o (source) In the next major release (10.6)
                    # support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change
                      for Windows 8.1
                    # support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and
                      gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions in web browser
                 plug-ins used for viewing PDF files, manual-to-manual
                 links do not resolve. Clicking a link may result in no
                 action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF
                 manual (instead of the target in the intended PDF
                 manual).
                 The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers
                 on Windows and Linux platforms. This behavior does not
                 affect the links in the table of contents, the index, or
                 the links to content within the same PDF manual. Because
                 of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF
                 manuals is compromised. However, PDF is still ideal for
                 printing.
                 Mentor Graphics continues to monitor the situation and
                 will adapt to future industry developments. For a
                 fully-functional navigational experience, use the HTML
                 manuals.
               o In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows
                 8.1 will be dropped.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.5d
       Key Information Compatibility

     * [nodvtid] - (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is
       fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may
       be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI
       usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:

       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or
       inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.
     * dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set
       to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After the
       'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be
       made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.
     * dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an
       optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.
     * dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them
       glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256,
       of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was
       being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained
       a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in
       it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog
       but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now,
       the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI
       task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs
       failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs.
     * dvt90298 - (results) A VHDL array connected to a Verilog nettype or
       interconnect array port declared with packed dimensions was
       connected in reverse order.
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * dvt90658 - (results) Added support to correctly parse nested
       comments in liberty files under an option. option
       -pa_libertyNestedCmnts can be used to enable parsing of nested
       comments in liberty files.
     * dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being
       driven by constants E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1; Questa PASim
       corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch
       -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being
       driven by constants.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support of upf defined logic ports in
       UPF commands - set_isolation, set_level_shifter, set_repeater and
       set_port_attributes. It has been enabled under vopt option
       -pa_enable=logicconnectivity.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support to honor power states defined
       on repeater_supply_set of set_repeater command. Following simstates
       are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support to honor power states defined
       on driver_supply/repeater_supply mentioned in set_port_attributes
       command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL
       and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support to honor power states defined
       on input_supply_set/output_supply_set/internal_supply_set of
       set_level_shifter command. Following simstates are only supported -
       CORRUPT and NORMAL.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the
       status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning
       is issued if more than one option is provided.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report
       (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first
       10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked.
       Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= <i
       >'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith
       tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch
       '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the
       bin will be reported.
     * dvt78649 - (results) The reporting of non-masking conditions for
       ternary expressions is enhanced by adding the state of select
       expression for implicant and alternate branches. The FEC report now
       shows the state of select condition required to cover a term in the
       implicant or alternate branch alongwith other non-masking
       conditions.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt86458 - (source) VRM testlist functionality now automatically
       populates the testname parameter using the exact entry in the
       testlist. In order to append the seed or repeat to the testname, %s
       and %n should be specified in the testlist directly.
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt91555 - (results) The -fixedtotalcov option is added in vcover
       trend html report to display the actual total coverage values in
       Coverage Summary graph irrespective of selected coverage types in
       that graph. If no coverage type is selected then only the total
       coverage is displayed in that graph.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In the next major release (10.6)
          + support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows
            8.1
          + support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be
            dropped
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt95319 - "vopt" can crash when using -debugdb and the path name
       to the "work" library is very long and the top designunit name is
       also very long. This problem has been resolved.
     * dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the
       status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning
       is issued if more than one option is provided.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt90005 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the
       Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type and in "by file" mode
       did not work. It resulted in the warning message: # ** Warning:
       (vish-4036) The 'coverage exclude' command had no effect on
       some/all objects because # no matching coverage data was found.
       this has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be
       exclude with no warning.
     * dvt69668 - The UI can freeze unpredictably when the Coverage
       Analysis window is opened when invoking vsim. This issue has been
       resolved.
     * dvt90759 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the
       Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type did not work. It
       resulted in the 4014 warning message: "no matching object found".
       This has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be
       exclude with no warning.
     * dvt90591 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Statement,
       Branch, and Expression coverage panes, if filtereing (any
       combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied and some items
       of a multi-item line were not being displayed, the item numbers for
       the remaining displayed items could be incorrect. In addition, if
       the "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu was then applied to the
       incorrecly numbered displaye item, the exclude would be applied to
       the incorrect item. This has been fixed.
     * dvt88300 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Condition (and
       other) coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss,
       and excluded) was applied, some items would be displayed when they
       should be hidden by the filtering and vice versa. This has been
       fixed.
     * dvt91564 - Searching in the Structure window can cause the user
       interface to freeze under some circumstances. This issue has been
       resolved.
     * dvt90075 - When viewing FSM coverage analysis, filtering out
       covered states and transitions did not work correctly. This issues
       has been resolved.
     * dvt90155 - A force operation on a wreal interconnect would resault
       in a crash. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt92169 - Objects window Kind filtering was not being restored
       correctly after a restart operation.
     * dvt89554 - Use of "examine -time" inside a "when -fast" command
       fails to read data values correctly. This issues has been resolved.
     * dvt94499 - Running vsim from a .BAT file on Windows can fail when
       some arguments contain a trailing backslash ('\'). This issue has
       been resolved.
     * dvt94465 - The Code Coverage Analysis window does not track by-file
       toggle coverage. This is intended as by-file toggle coverage is not
       supported. The CCA window will not display a message to this effect
       when the window is in by-file mode.
     * dvt95571 - The GUI will crash when trying to perform wildcard
       expansion in a Primitive scope. This issue has been resolved.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt89423 - Fixed a bug where non-blocking assignment to a clocking
       block output was getting ignored in some cases if more than one
       non-blocking assignments were being happening during same clock
       cycle and output has an event based skew.
     * dvt91297 - A vector with bits connected to different instances of
       an instance array instantiation was connected improperly in some
       unusual cases.
     * dvt87810 - Vopt would give errors like this:
       ** Error: test.sv(17): (vopt-2132) Instance 'dut' has a
       non-optimizable form of recursive instantiation.
       with recursively instantiated modules within generate loops and
       conditions.
     * dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or
       inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.
     * dvt92487 - Fix vsim elaboration crash related to concatenations
       connected to ports of inlined module instances.
     * dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set
       to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After the
       'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be
       made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.
     * dvt93575 - Fixed a vopt crash when doing concatenation of queues.
       Example :- queue = '{ queue, queue_ };
     * dvt93510 - Fixed a vlog crash when virtual interface specialization
       is used with empty parameter. Example:- virtual intf #(.param())
     * dvt92312 - Fixed a vsim invalid error when nested unpacked array
       concatenation is passed to a port and internal concatenation is
       regular vector concatenation.
     * dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an
       optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.
     * [nodvtid] - SDF annotation fails with array port when zero timing
       delay is specified in SDF. If sdf has non-zero then annotations
       went fine. Fixed so that annotations proceed even if sdf file has
       zero delays.
     * [nodvtid] - vlog's -E output might incorrectly emit
       "`pragmaprotect" rather than "`pragma" whitespace "protect".

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt90896 - Vcom could crash when trying to report an invalid field
       of a record if the prefix of the selected name was an index on an
       array access type.
     * dvt91137 - A generic of a record type might receive an incorrect
       actual value when the actual was a function call and there existed
       another different function call actual for a different formal.
     * dvt91565 - If an architecture called a subprogram in a package, and
       if that subprogram contained a call to another subprogram, defined
       only in the package body and found via a forward declaration also
       in the package body, then subprogram inlining could produce bad
       code that would crash the simulator when the design was loaded.
     * dvt91501 - For some specific cases of signal assignment statement,
       signal was not getting updated properly. This has been fixed.
     * dvt92589 - Definition of a very large constant array within a
       package could cause elaboration of the package to exhaust all
       available stack space, causing the simulator to crash. Recompiling
       the package with -O0 or -O1 is a temporary measure to prevent the
       crash.
     * dvt92840 - Access to a shared variable through an interface package
       could cause the elaboration phase of the simulator to crash.
     * dvt93089 - A call to a shared variable's method from within a
       subprogram of an uninstantiated package could cause the simulator
       to crash.
     * dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256,
       of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.
     * dvt90391 - In certail specific cases of generics of record types,
       vsim use to give the error "Internal error in signal creation".
       This has been fixed
     * dvt91615 - In Some specific cases, vsim use to crash while inlining
       a procedure. This has been fixed
     * dvt81635 - For certain specific cases, vsim issues a fatal error
       while trying to optimize functions with assertion statements.This
       has been fixed.
     * dvt92555 - For certain specific cases, vsim use to give incorrect
       outputs due to cetain clocked process optimizations.This has been
       fixed.
     * dvt94049 - The compiler incorrectly reported the following error
       when encountering an alias of an operator function instance:
** Error: Alias with operator symbol designator must denote a function.

       The compiler also incorrectly generated code for newly-defined
       operator functions with generic-typed parameters.
     * dvt89781 - For some specific cases in novopt mode, we used to do
       port collapsing optimization incorrectly. This has been fixed.
     * dvt90004 - In some specific cases of procedure inlining, vopt or
       vcom in novopt flow used to crash. This has been fixed.
     * dvt93277 - The vmake command would not work when there was a
       dependency on an encrypted design unit.
     * dvt95670 - The attributes A'range and A'reverse_range would give
       incorrect ranges if A's bounds are defined with impure function
       calls.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt92791 - Bug in the sccom distributed flow with missing systemc
       exported modules has been fixed.
     * dvt95642 - sccom merge error (sccom-6165) with a circular dependent
       forward declared module instantiation has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt89182 - vsim crashes in some cases when an assertion with
       boolean property had a pass action block.
     * dvt90293 - $past(v,n) gives incorrect initial values when n is
       greater than 1.
     * dvt90240 - Fixed a bug where immediate assertions in functions were
       consuming high memory if they had return statement in the action
       block.
     * dvt90588 - vsim's memory usage keeps on increasing after a
       multi-clock assertion gets disabled.
     * dvt95904 - Assertion shows INACTIVE in the waveform even when it is
       ACTIVE.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt90298 - (results) A VHDL array connected to a Verilog nettype or
       interconnect array port declared with packed dimensions was
       connected in reverse order.
     * dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was
       being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained
       a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in
       it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog
       but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now,
       the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI
       task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs
       failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs.
     * dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read,
       correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array
       signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * [nodvtid] - Minor fixes to VRM automatic email function: (a) the
       EMAIL_RECIPIENTS, EMAIL_SECTIONS, and EMAIL_SERVERS parameters may
       now contain space/comma-separated lists of strings, and (b) the
       EMAIL_SERVERS parameter is properly processed when multiple server
       names are provided.
     * dvt87578 - The vrun -status report now correctly expands the
       relative path of the mergefile parameter.
     * dvt94450 - Fixed crash in VRM GUI when expanding Runnable tree with
       at least one repeat override specified.
     * dvt94326 - In the VRM GUI, the "Suspend/Terminate Selected Jobs"
       menu item is disabled if none of the selected jobs is running.
       Likewise, the "Resume Selected Jobs" menu item is disabled if none
       of the selected jobs is suspended.
     * dvt94708 - The Timeout spinners on the Runtime tab of the VRM
       Congifuration Edit dialog were too narrow to display timeout values
       consisting of four or more digits.
     * dvt93999 - Fixed problem where known-path parameters whose values
       were not absolute paths were not being expanded by the C/SQL API.
       Fixed error in TCL API path expansion when TCL-special characters
       were included in the path. Fixed TCL error in two path-expansion
       error messages.
     * dvt95137 - Fixed problem with the way non-standard normalizetime
       values (generally from transform rules) are displayed in the
       Results Analysis window.
     * dvt92310 - Fixed bug where VRM would crash if "-html" status-report
       option was added to a regular regression-run command line.
     * dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not
       supported. Such an action would break the integrity of the bin
       counts in the database. An error message is issued when an attempt
       is made to delete a test while using 'coverage edit -delete -test <
       test name >'.
     * dvt86860 - Fixed problem in VRM on Windows where cmd.exe and other
       utilities on the PATH could not be located.
     * dvt96255 - Fixed TCL error when using "vrun -kill" option to kill a
       regression test in testname mode.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt90658 - (results) Added support to correctly parse nested
       comments in liberty files under an option. option
       -pa_libertyNestedCmnts can be used to enable parsing of nested
       comments in liberty files.
     * dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being
       driven by constants E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1; Questa PASim
       corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch
       -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being
       driven by constants.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.5d
     * dvt93896 - The [wlfman filter] and [wlf2vcd] performance has been
       dramatically improved for WLF files containing large numbers of
       single bit Verilog nets.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.5d
     * dvt92311 - Added a new vsim option -capstats and a new commands
       called capstats to print out capstats report. This report generates
       complete memory usage of the design. The capstats option is defined
       as follows:
-capstats[=&ltargs>]
where &ltargs> are all,classes,qdas,vmems,solver,assertions,cvg,eor and filename
=&ltfile_name>. The arguments can be specified separated by comma or '+'.

       If -capstats is specified without any arguments, a summary capstats
       report is generated at the end of simulation. If -capstats is
       specified with argument 'eor', a summary capstats report is
       generated at the end of each run command.
       A verbose report can be generated if vsim is invoked with -capacity
       option. The level of verbosity in the report can be controlled by
       specifying options as follows:
       If -capstats is specified with argument 'all', a complete verbose
       report is generated. If -capstats is specified with arguments
       'classes','qdas','vmems','solver','assertions' or 'cvg', a verbose
       report is generated for the specified types.
       The report is printed in the transcript file if no filename is
       specified.
       The capstats command has been modified as follows:
capstats [-all] [-classes] [-qdas] [-vmems] [-solver] [-assertions] [-cvg] [< fi
lename>]

       A summary capstats report is generated if no arguments are
       specified.
       The report can be redirected to a file by specifying the file name
       otherwise the report is generated in the transcript file.
       A full verbose report can be generated by specifying option 'all'.
       A partial verbose report can be generated for specific types by
       specifying those options. Please note that the verbose report is
       only generated if vsim is run with -capacity option.
     * [nodvtid] - The "find signals", "find nets", and "find instances"
       commands are now supported in -batch mode.
     * dvt15443 - When vsim crashes with SIGSEGV signal, we were only
       giving HDL call stack. But, it wasn't complete stack in case of the
       crash in user's C code (like DPI/PLI etc). Now, vsim will generate
       stacktrace file and print full stacktrace in transcript as well, in
       addition to existing HDL call stack.
     * dvt94809 - Added switch "-pdupath[=&ltlib_path>]" which can be used
       with vsim to specify library path for PDU when library is moved
       after top level optimized design unit creation. If optional
       &ltlib_path> is not specified PDU will be looked into current
       working directory.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.5d
     * dvt90505 - The Files View collapses the tree whenever there is an
       update to the current context or run state. The view will now
       remain expanded and the selection and filters will remain in place
       during any updates.
     * dvt91003 - The Coverage Report dialog box now has an option for the
       user to select how the report is displayed. The options are
       "notepad", "source viewer", "none", or "user-defined editor". The
       user-defined editor choice uses the EDITOR environment variable, or
       the PrefMain(Editor) preference variable to determine which editor
       to invoke. Once a choice is made, it will be persistent across
       sessions.
     * dvt90333 - It is now possible to display a summary rollup of
       coverage numbers in the Structure window. To enable the summary,
       select the menu Structure->Code Coverage->View Code Coverage
       Summary. The summary will appear at the top of the Structure
       window.
     * dvt88977 - "Add" -> "To Watch" has been added to the Source window
       popup menu.
     * dvt23220 - The "radix" command will now accept HEXADECIMAL to
       indicate displaying base 16 numeric values using uppercase A-F
       characters. The of "hexadecimal" in lowercase will continue to
       display base 16 numeric values using lowercase a-f characters.
     * dvt95331 - The color of the selected items highlight in the Wave
       window scrollbar can be changed by setting
       PrefWave(mapSelectColor).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.5d
     * dvt89504 - Supported the connection of array of interface instance
       passed as a port to instance array. Example:- intf i
       [p1:0][p2:0](); // interface array bot b[p1:0](i); // This will
       connect each b[j] to i[j]
     * dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them
       glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.
     * dvt62609 - Allowed macro substitution inside string literals using
       the -svext=mewq argument to the vlog command.
     * dvt93489 - The vlog/vopt -svext=dmsbw option can be used to drive
       the MSB unconnected bits of the wider hiconn (output) or the wider
       loconn (input) in an otherwise collapsible port connection. With
       the option, the unconnected bits are driven with zero, otherwise
       they float.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.5d
     * dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report
       (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first
       10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked.
       Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= <i
       >'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith
       tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch
       '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the
       bin will be reported.
     * [nodvtid] - The covergoups page in the coverage HTML report has
       been changed. The new page has many new features, for example
       sorting and searching. Also its layout has been enhanced to be more
       clear. The new page works on all major browsers. We recommend using
       at least IE 11.0, Firefox 42.0 or Google Chrome 47.0
     * dvt78649 - (results) The reporting of non-masking conditions for
       ternary expressions is enhanced by adding the state of select
       expression for implicant and alternate branches. The FEC report now
       shows the state of select condition required to cover a term in the
       implicant or alternate branch alongwith other non-masking
       conditions.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.5d
     * dvt90413 - The "vcover merge" '-ignoredusig' argument is
       deprecated. Instead, use the new '-mergedesigndiffs' argument. The
       warning messages still appear when the '-mergedesigndiffs' argument
       is used. Note: Both '-ignoredusig' and '-mergedesigndiffs' are
       ignored for the coverstore case.
     * dvt89824 - Two routines have been added to the UCDB API.
/*
 * ucdb_GetTestIndex()
 *
 * Return the index value for test record.
 * Return -1 if an error occurs.
 */
int
ucdb_GetTestIndex(ucdbT db, ucdbTestT test);

/*
 * ucdb_GetIthTest()
 *
 * Return the test record having the indicated index value.
 * Return NULL if an error occurs.
 */
ucdbTestT
ucdb_GetIthTest(ucdbT db, int index);

     * dvt91555 - (results) The -fixedtotalcov option is added in vcover
       trend html report to display the actual total coverage values in
       Coverage Summary graph irrespective of selected coverage types in
       that graph. If no coverage type is selected then only the total
       coverage is displayed in that graph.
     * [nodvtid] - Tests listed in a VRM testlist file now support the
       "%n" and "%s" tokens in parameter overrides.
     * dvt86458 - (source) VRM testlist functionality now automatically
       populates the testname parameter using the exact entry in the
       testlist. In order to append the seed or repeat to the testname, %s
       and %n should be specified in the testlist directly.
     * [nodvtid] - The "-debug" option on the vrun command may now
       optionally take the form "-debug=" where "flags" is a
       comma-separated list of debug flags. The only debug flag supported
       currently is "usertcl" which will cause a message to be emitted
       before and after any usertcl procedure is executed. The legacy
       "-debug" option behaves as before.
     * [nodvtid] - The TCL status report from VRM now includes total and
       testplan coverage data (per mergefile). All status reports now
       report coverage from VRM status event log instead of re-reading the
       merged UCDB file.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.5d
     * [nodvtid] - Added support of -exclude_elements option in UPF
       commands - set_isolation, set_level_shifter, set_retention and
       set_repeater.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support of upf defined logic ports in
       UPF commands - set_isolation, set_level_shifter, set_repeater and
       set_port_attributes. It has been enabled under vopt option
       -pa_enable=logicconnectivity.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support to honor power states defined
       on repeater_supply_set of set_repeater command. Following simstates
       are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support to honor power states defined
       on driver_supply/repeater_supply mentioned in set_port_attributes
       command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL
       and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added support to honor power states defined
       on input_supply_set/output_supply_set/internal_supply_set of
       set_level_shifter command. Following simstates are only supported -
       CORRUPT and NORMAL.
     * dvt84885 - Added support for Portable DB which allows dumping the
       PA information model database in design.bin.padb in CWD by
       default.However,if user specifies designfile name by +/-designfile
       designfilename option in vopt, PA database will be dumped in
       designfilename.padb.Also,user can specify PA database name with
       -pa_db option in vopt (e.g. -pa_db user/test/qpadb.padb ).-pa_db
       option takes precedence over +/-designfile option or default.PA DB
       can be accessed by specifying -pa_db option in vsim and +padb in
       visualizer.
     * dvt83747 - Added support for vopt option -pa_upfsanitychecks which
       will check for UPF syntax errors before loading the design and also
       list down errors encountered in applying low power intent on the
       design. In case of no error, tool will continue to work as usual.
     * [nodvtid] - Added support for Backward Compatibility feature which
       will enable PA information model database dumped by an older
       release to be loaded correctly by newer releases. This support is
       present in release 10.5c onwards.
     * dvt84882 - The signals which are given with -no_retention option in
       set_retention command are now reported in report.pa.txt Example
       snippet from report.pa.txt: Retention Strategy: pd_retention, File:
       ./src/no_ret_1/test.upf(43). Not Retained Signals: 1. Scope:
       /tb/top_vl2, File: ./src/no_ret_1/reg_vl.v(1) 1.
