<ul><li>(source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:
<br>
1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
<br>
OR
<br>
2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines. DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
<br>
The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the above will incur the following warning at elab time
<br>
<pre>
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.
</pre>
and the fatal error at runtime:
<pre>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt95794 - Added modelsim.ini variable "AllowCheckpointCpp", a companion variable for existing vsim -allowcheckpointcpp switch

<pre>
   -allowcheckpointcpp 1|0 Turn on/off the support for checkpointing foreign C++ libraries.
                           Must be used in the vsim session where a checkpoint is created.

; Enable the support for checkpointing foreign C++ libraries.
; The valid arguments are: 1 and 0. 
;     1 : turn on the support
;     0 : turn off the support (default)
; This option is not supported on the Windows platforms.
;
; AllowCheckpointCpp = 1

</pre> </li>
</ul>

<ul><li>In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.</li>
 <li><p>
Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li><p>
10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be linked in with "msvcr120.dll".
If you have SystemC or PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be re-compiled with 10.5. 
Windows platform compiler details is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product. 
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for download on a request basis.
<p>
Compiler versions have not been changed compared to previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more details.
</li>
 <li>(source) In the next major release (10.6)<br>
   <ul> 
   <li>support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows 8.1
   <li>support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
</ul></li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions in web browser plug-ins used for viewing PDF files, manual-to-manual links do not resolve. Clicking a link may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the target in the intended PDF manual).<br>
The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. This behavior does not affect the links in the table of contents, the index, or the links to content within the same PDF manual. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. However, PDF is still ideal for printing.<br>
Mentor Graphics continues to monitor the situation and will adapt to future industry developments. For a fully-functional navigational experience, use the HTML manuals.</li>
 <li>In 10.8 major release, support for windows 7 and windows 8.1 will be dropped. </li>

<ul><li>dvt89393 - (results) A concatenation of nets connected to an out or inout unpacked net array port was connected in reverse order.</li>
 <li>dvt73613 - (results) At 'restore' time, the message counts are set to be the values that they had at 'checkpoint' time. After 
the 'restore', a call to the 'msgZeroMessageCounts' TCL command may be made from the GUI/vish to reset the message counts to 0.</li>
 <li>dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.</li>
 <li>dvt89061 - (results) Enhanced the xprop assertions to make them glitch free under a vopt option -xprop_enable=glitchfreeassert.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt93451 - (results) Vsim crashed when bit slices wider than 256, of VHDL signals, were read through built-in UVM backdoor functions.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now, the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs. </li>
 <li>dvt90298 - (results) A VHDL array connected to a Verilog nettype or interconnect array port declared with packed dimensions was connected in reverse order.</li>
 <li>dvt96160 - (results) Now built-in version of uvm_hdl_read, correctly reads the values from arbitrary slices of VHDL array signals with non-zero LSB/MSB indices.
</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt90658 - (results) Added support to correctly parse nested comments in liberty files under an option. option -pa_libertyNestedCmnts can be used to enable parsing of nested comments in liberty files.</li>
 <li>dvt83154 - (results) Questa PASim by default corrupts signals being driven by constants 
E.g. For RTL assign out = 1'b1;
Questa PASim corrupts the 'out' signal. Added a switch -pa_enable=constasfeedthru to avoid the corruption of signals being driven by constants.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support of upf defined logic ports in UPF commands - set_isolation, set_level_shifter, set_repeater and set_port_attributes. It has been enabled under vopt option -pa_enable=logicconnectivity.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support to honor power states defined on repeater_supply_set of set_repeater command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support to honor power states defined on driver_supply/repeater_supply mentioned in set_port_attributes command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT, NORMAL and CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added support to honor power states defined on input_supply_set/output_supply_set/internal_supply_set of set_level_shifter command. Following simstates are only supported - CORRUPT and NORMAL.</li>

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95511 - (source) The profile status command reports on the status of a single option, but accepts multiple options. A warning is issued if more than one option is provided.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first 10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked. Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= &lt;i &gt;'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the bin will be reported.</li>
 <li>dvt78649 - (results) The reporting of non-masking conditions for ternary expressions is enhanced by adding the state of select expression for implicant and alternate branches. The FEC report now shows the state of select condition required to cover a term in the implicant or alternate branch alongwith other non-masking conditions. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Verification Management  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt86458 - (source) VRM testlist functionality now automatically populates the testname parameter using the exact entry in the testlist. In order to append the seed or repeat to the testname, %s and %n should be specified in the testlist directly.</li>
 <li>dvt31204 - (results) Deleting a test from a merge file is not supported.
Such an action would break the integrity of the bin counts in the database.
An error message is issued when an attempt is made to delete a test while using
'coverage edit -delete -test < test name >'.</li>
 <li>dvt91555 - (results) The -fixedtotalcov option is added in vcover trend html report to display the actual total coverage values in Coverage Summary graph irrespective of selected coverage types in that graph.

<ul><li>dvt90005 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the Code Coverage Analysis window
using FSM type and in "by file" mode did not work.  It resulted in the warning message:
# ** Warning: (vish-4036) The 'coverage exclude' command had no effect on some/all objects because
# no matching coverage data was found.

this has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be exclude with no warning.
</li>
 <li>dvt69668 - The UI can freeze unpredictably when the Coverage Analysis window is opened when invoking vsim.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt90759 - Using "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu in the Code Coverage Analysis window using FSM type did not work. It resulted in the 4014 warning message: "no matching object found".  This has been fixed so that the selected item will correctly be exclude with no warning. </li>
 <li>dvt90591 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Statement, Branch, and Expression coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied and some items of a multi-item line were not being displayed, the item numbers for the remaining displayed items could be incorrect.   In addition, if the "Exclude Selection" from the popup menu was then applied to the incorrecly numbered displaye item, the exclude would be applied to the incorrect item.  This has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt88300 - In the Code Coverage Analysis window for Condition (and other) coverage panes, if filtereing (any combination of hit, miss, and excluded) was applied, some items would be displayed when they should be hidden by the filtering and vice versa.  This has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt91564 - Searching in the Structure window can cause the user interface to freeze under some circumstances.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt90075 - When viewing FSM coverage analysis, filtering out covered states and transitions did not work correctly.  This issues has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt90155 - A force operation on a wreal interconnect would resault in a crash.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt92169 - Objects window Kind filtering was not being restored correctly after a restart operation.</li>
 <li>dvt89554 - Use of "examine -time" inside a "when -fast" command fails to read data values correctly.  This issues has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt94499 - Running vsim from a .BAT file on Windows can fail when some arguments contain a trailing backslash ('\').  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt94465 - The Code Coverage Analysis window does not track by-file toggle coverage.  This is intended as by-file toggle coverage is not supported.  The CCA window will not display a message to this effect when the window is in by-file mode.</li>
 <li>dvt95571 - The GUI will crash when trying to perform wildcard expansion in a Primitive scope.  This issue has been resolved.</li>

Example:- virtual intf #(.param())</li>
 <li>dvt92312 - Fixed a vsim invalid error when nested unpacked array concatenation is passed to a port and internal concatenation is regular vector concatenation.</li>
 <li>dvt87976 - (results) A net that is disconnected due to an optimizations could be logged rather than its merged copy.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - SDF annotation fails with array port when zero timing delay is specified in SDF. If sdf has non-zero then annotations went fine. Fixed so that annotations proceed even if sdf file has zero delays.</li>

 <li>dvt91137 - A generic of a record type might receive an incorrect actual value when the actual was a function call and there existed another different function call actual for a different formal.</li>
 <li>dvt91565 - If an architecture called a subprogram in a package, and if that subprogram contained a call to another subprogram, defined only in the package body and found via a forward declaration also in the package body, then subprogram inlining could produce bad code that would crash the simulator when the design was loaded.
</li>
 <li>dvt91501 - For some specific cases of signal assignment statement, signal was not getting updated properly. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt92589 - Definition of a very large constant array within a package could cause elaboration of the package to exhaust all available stack space, causing the simulator to crash. Recompiling the package with -O0 or -O1 is a temporary measure to prevent the crash.</li>
 <li>dvt92840 - Access to a shared variable through an interface package could cause the elaboration phase of the simulator to crash.</li>
 <li>dvt93089 - A call to a shared variable's method from within a subprogram of an uninstantiated package could cause the simulator to crash.</li>

<ul><li>dvt90298 - (results) A VHDL array connected to a Verilog nettype or interconnect array port declared with packed dimensions was connected in reverse order.</li>
 <li>dvt95057 - (source) Fixed a bug where a SystemVerilog task was being allowed inside a SystemVerilog function even if it contained a DPI task call. The DPI task call can potentially have delays in it. It is illegal to call a task from a function in SystemVerilog but we do allow it in case task does not contain any delays. Now, the check for the delay in the task also includes the check for DPI task call. This change may result in some of the customer designs failing to compile. It is recommended to fix the designs. </li>

<p /><a name="generalenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>General Enhancements in 10.5d</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt92311 - Added a new vsim option -capstats and a new commands called capstats to print out capstats report. This report generates complete memory usage of the design.
 The capstats option is defined as follows:
<pre>
-capstats[=&ltargs&gt] 
where &ltargs&gt are all,classes,qdas,vmems,solver,assertions,cvg,eor and filename=&ltfile_name&gt. The arguments can be specified separated by comma or '+'.
</pre>
If -capstats is specified without any arguments, a summary capstats report is generated at the end of simulation. If -capstats is specified with argument 'eor', a summary capstats report is generated at the end of each run command.<br>
A verbose report can be generated if vsim is invoked with -capacity option.
The level of verbosity in the report can be controlled by specifying options as follows:<br>
If -capstats is specified with argument 'all', a complete verbose report is generated. If -capstats is specified with arguments 'classes','qdas','vmems','solver','assertions' or 'cvg', a verbose report is generated for the specified types.
<br>
The report is printed in the transcript file if no filename is specified.
<br>
<br>

The capstats command has been modified as follows:
<pre>
capstats [-all] [-classes] [-qdas] [-vmems] [-solver] [-assertions] [-cvg] [&lt filename&gt]
</pre>

A summary capstats report is generated if no arguments are specified. <br>
The report can be redirected to a file by specifying the file name otherwise the report is generated in the transcript file.<br>
A full verbose report can be generated by specifying option 'all'.<br>

A partial verbose report can be generated for specific types by specifying those options. Please note that the verbose report is only generated if vsim is run with -capacity option.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - The "find signals", "find nets", and "find instances" commands are now supported in -batch mode.</li>
 <li>dvt15443 - When vsim crashes with SIGSEGV signal, we were only giving HDL call stack. But, it wasn't complete stack in case of the crash in user's C code (like DPI/PLI etc). Now, vsim will generate stacktrace file and print full stacktrace in transcript as well, in addition to existing HDL call stack. </li>
 <li>dvt94809 - Added switch "-pdupath[=&ltlib_path&gt]" which can be used with vsim to specify library path for PDU when library is moved after top level optimized design unit creation. If optional &ltlib_path&gt is not specified PDU will be looked into current working directory.</li>

<ul><li>dvt90505 - The Files View collapses the tree whenever there is an update to the current context or run state.  The view will now remain expanded and the selection and filters will remain in place during any updates.</li>
 <li>dvt91003 - The Coverage Report dialog box now has an option for the user to select how the report is displayed.  The options are "notepad", "source viewer", "none", or "user-defined editor".  The user-defined editor choice uses the EDITOR environment variable, or the PrefMain(Editor) preference variable to determine which editor to invoke.  Once a choice is made, it will be persistent across sessions. </li>
 <li>dvt90333 - It is now possible to display a summary rollup of coverage numbers in the Structure window.  To enable the summary, select the menu Structure->Code Coverage->View Code Coverage Summary.  The summary will appear at the top of the Structure window.</li>
 <li>dvt88977 - "Add" -> "To Watch" has been added to the Source window popup menu.</li>
 <li>dvt23220 - The "radix" command will now accept HEXADECIMAL to indicate displaying base 16 numeric values using uppercase A-F characters.  The of "hexadecimal" in lowercase will continue to display base 16 numeric values using lowercase a-f characters.</li>

<ul><li>dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first 10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked. Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= &lt;i &gt;'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the bin will be reported.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - The covergoups page in the coverage HTML report has been changed. The new page has many new features, for example sorting and searching. Also its layout has been enhanced to be more clear. The new page works on all major browsers. We recommend using at least IE 11.0, Firefox 42.0 or Google Chrome 47.0</li>
 <li>dvt78649 - (results) The reporting of non-masking conditions for ternary expressions is enhanced by adding the state of select expression for implicant and alternate branches.

 <li>dvt91555 - (results) The -fixedtotalcov option is added in vcover trend html report to display the actual total coverage values in Coverage Summary graph irrespective of selected coverage types in that graph. If no coverage type is selected then only the total coverage is displayed in that graph.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Tests listed in a VRM testlist file now support the "%n" and "%s" tokens in parameter overrides.</li>
 <li>dvt86458 - (source) VRM testlist functionality now automatically populates the testname parameter using the exact entry in the testlist. In order to append the seed or repeat to the testname, %s and %n should be specified in the testlist directly.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - The "-debug" option on the vrun command may now optionally take the form "-debug=<flags>" where "flags" is a comma-separated list of debug flags. The only debug flag supported currently is "usertcl" which will cause a message to be emitted before and after any usertcl procedure is executed. The legacy "-debug" option behaves as before.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - The TCL status report from VRM now includes total and testplan coverage data (per mergefile). All status reports now report coverage from VRM status event log instead of re-reading the merged UCDB file.</li>
