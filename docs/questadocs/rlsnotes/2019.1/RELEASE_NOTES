   _______________________________________________________________________

   Key Information
     * The vlog -wireasinterconnect option is deprecated due to
       performance issues, and a warning message is issued to that effect
       when used. The vopt -rnmautointeconnect option is preferred because
       it takes advantage of the vopt analysis to more selectively convert
       wires to interconnect. Only wires connected upwards from
       real/wreal/nettype/interconnect ports are converted.
     * QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of
       deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
       recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
       (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
       process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will
       become an error in later releases. The reason for this change is to
       remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation
       libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the
       post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with
       pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining
       a two-step flow.
     * QSIM-1683 - Note-3865 has been replaced with non-suppressible
       Warning-3865 and message has also been updated.
** Warning: (vsim-3865) Due to PLI being present, global +acc is being enabled a
utomatically. This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. Please use vsi
m -no_autoacc to disable this feature. This feature is now deprecated and will b
e removed from future releases.

       Users should not rely on tool to automatically add global +acc for
       visibility in 2-step flow with PLI. It is recommended that users
       specify -no_autoacc vsim option and provide targeted +acc setting
       or TAB file for require PLI visibility.
     * There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1. However, if
       you are migrating to 2019.1 from a release like 10.6 and older,
       please note that release 2019.1 uses FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
          + (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will
            flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

            Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag
            below error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

            In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
            recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from
            user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt
            flow completely.

     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

       other countries.
     * Starting 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have
       discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to
       support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until
       their planned End Of Life (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid
       2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 2019.1

   Key Information Compatibility
     * QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of
       deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The
       recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt
       (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation
       process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will
       become an error in later releases. The reason for this change is to
       remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation
       libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the
       post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with
       pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining
       a two-step flow.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-4784 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one
       element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are
       different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&&
       and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV
       HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions.
       Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) Vsim switch -assertcover option is deprecated
       now. Using -assertcover in vsim command line generates
       'vsimk-16036' suppressible error. Assertion coverage is available
       by default. If various assertion counts are required, switch
       -assertcounts may be used.
     * QSIM-38134 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt
       -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an
       IfElse constraint with constant condition.
       By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is
       triggered.
       vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to
       the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if
       solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
       When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant,
       a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.

     * QSIM-30243 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-9374 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-7336 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-9963 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function
       calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a
       $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant
       (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a
       fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result
       of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver
       during a randomize call.
     * QSIM-23582 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The SystemVerilog 'iff' property operator now
       associates to the right. IEEE 1800-2017 table 16-3.
     * QSIM-19967 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle
       was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all
       shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG
       (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results
       of a call to the shuffle method. In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG
       selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
       +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
       -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle
       method The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim. For
       backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled
       (-thrdrngshfl)
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are
       present.
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.
     * QSIM-52457 - (results) Added an error check when class types are
       not assignable under -pedanticerrors.
     * QSIM-33083 - (results) Questa used to report an error on
       referencing tasks/functions defined later in the compilation unit
       scope. This is now fixed.
     * QSIM-4103 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed
       structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of
       a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
       The support has been added as default and will be an error with
       -pedanticerrors.
     * QSIM-32714 - (results) The behavior of SolveFailDebug (for
       SystemVerilog randomize() calls) has been changed. Enabling
       SolveFailDebug will only generate a constraint contradiction report
       for randomize() calls that fail due to having no solutions when
       SolveFailSeverity is set to a non-zero value. In addition, the
       default value of the following vsim modelsim.ini variables has been
       changed: - SolveFailDebug: change to 1 (basic debug enabled) from 0
       (off) - SolveFailSeverity: change to 1 (warning) from 0 (no
       message)
     * QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini
       files and deprecated warning message.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Xprop assertions has been disabled by default
       in pass and resolve mode. The user has to provide vopt option
       "-xprop,report={severity}" to enable the assertions in pass and
       resolve mode.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-28023 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked
       processes, forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation
       results. This has been fixed now.
     * VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents
       of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not
       included. Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are
       also excluded. Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed"
       are filtered out of logging.
     * QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is
       connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output
       was incorrect. This has been fixed.

   Mixed Language Compatibility
     * QSIM-53075 - (results) When passing a Verilog unpacked array to a
       VHDL array generic, values were mapped from the, Verilog value at
       the low index was mapped to the VHDL position with the left index.
       parameter int val[3:0] when passed to generic g1 :
       integer_array(3:0) would map val[0] => g1(3), val[1] => g1(2),
       val[2] => g1(1), val[3]=>g1(0). Now the values are passed like
       val[0] => g1[0], val[1] => g1(1), val[2] => g1(2), and val[3] =>
       g1(3).

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * QSIM-20422 - (source) Added a suppressible error (9032) for cases -
       when ack port is already driven in HDL and because of which tool
       will not dump any drivers for the ack port. Earlier this
       information was dumped in a report file. This change will not
       impact the results but users might have to suppress this error if
       issued.
     * QSIM-197 - (source, results) The following changes were updated in
       the HDL package functions to align them with UPF LRM 3.1:
         1. Added support for singleton class object upfDesignT.
         2. Added field current_simstate on native UPF object upfPdSsObjT
            to fetch current simstate of power domains or supply sets.
         3. Type definition of upfHandleT has been changed from chandle to
            SV int.
       Now we strictly follow the LRM guideline, which says that the
       handles to properties and iterators may be reused and are not valid
       for comparison.
     * QSIM-35670 - (source, results) Improved hier path parsing in UPF
       file.
     * QSIM-6965 - (source, results)
       Support of NOR style and NAND style isolation cells according to
       UPF 3.0
     * QSIM-840 - (source, results) Instantaneously corrupting the value
       of LHS in delayed continuos assignment on power down.
     * QSIM-10802 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption
       of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those
       always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are
       non-synthesizable. Users will be notified with a warning message
       (vopt-9031) whenever such blocks are ignored. To enable corruption
       for such always blocks use the vopt option
       -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.
     * QSIM-28733 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated - 1- parse the
       liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to
       option -pa_libertyfiles 2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is
       provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files,
       then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Change in behavior of Balloon-style level
       sensitive retention protocol: Previous tool retention behavior is
       to transfer the retained value on the register at the leading edge
       of the restore event (if the restore_condition is high). This has
       been changed to make the behavior LRM compliant. Now the tool will
       transfer the retained value on the register at the trailing edge of
       the restore_event (when restore_condition is high). User can get
       the old behavior using the option -pa_disable=trailingedgerestore
     * QSIM-20027 - (results) Added the support to report the switching
       activity of VHDL Enum and VHDL Boolean in "power report" command.
       This is enabled with "power add -vhdlint" option.
     * QSIM-19603 - (results) PA reports: report.upf.txt and
       report.mspa.txt will no longer be generated. Currently,
       report.pa.txt and report.de.txt provide all data used to be
       reported in the removed reports.
     * QSIM-7 - (results) Reduced the number of vopt options for PA. Some
       of the options have been made default and some have been
       deprecated.
       Three kinds of messages have been introduced for PA options
       cleanup:

     If the option has been made default, you will get the following
     warning:

     **Warning: (vopt-9033) Option -pa_upfextensions=xyz has been made
     default and will be deleted in next release.

     If the option has been deleted, you will get the following error:

     **Error (suppressible) : (vopt-9034) Option -pa_upfextensions=xyz
     has been deprecated and will be ignored.

     If the option has been modified, you will get the following warning:

     **Warning: (vopt-9035) Option "-pa_upfextensions=xyz" will be
     deprecated from next release. Use "-pa_xyz" instead.

     * QSIM-153 - (results) Added support to connect 3 PG pin ELS cells -
       earlier the cell were connected based on different rules. hence
       results will change
     * QSIM-16967 - (results) enhanced PA connection reports to show
       connection type along with connected net.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The assertion control option
       "-pa_enable=forceasrtoffpwrdown" has been improved to honor user's
       assertion control system task(e.g asserton, assertoff, assertkill)
       once the assertion is out of power down period.
       The assertions will remain disabled during power off period
       irrespective of any user assertion control system task.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A new option
       "-pa_enable=donttouchassertinbind" has been introduced to keep the
       assertions unaffected due to power down/power up in bind
       hierarchies.

   General Compatibility
     * QSIM-35502 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being
       printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of
       real types in VCD.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added enhancement to show warning 3040 in
       vopt for non existent parameters in design given with -G. Warnings
       are shown only for parameters whose path gets resolved in vopt. If
       there is a pdu in vopt design unit, warnings will be deferred to
       vsim. For foreign generics, which are added later in vsim in
       design, there will be warnings in vopt if -G is used in vopt. For
       small test: module top; parameter p = 1; initial $display(p);
       endmodule For command "vsim -c top -Gpr=3", warning 3040 will be
       shown in vopt, in place of vsim: ** Warning: (vopt-3040) Command
       line generic/parameter "pr" not found in design.

   SystemC Compatibility
     * QSIM-498 - (source, results) SystemC support has been upgraded to
       SystemC-2.3.2 from SystemC-2.3.1. Please refer to the SystemC
       Simulation chapter in the user's manual for SystemC-2.3.2
       incompatibilities with SystemC-2.3.1.

   User Interface Compatibility
     * QSIM-1762 - (source) The user interface for the solver profiler has
       been integrated into the vsim profiling commands. The vsim
       command-line option of "-solveprofile" has been deprecated. Use
       "vsim -autoprofile" or the vsim command "profile on" to enable vsim
       and solver profiling Use the "profile report -solver" vsim command
       to print the solver profile report. See the QuestaSim User Manual
       and Command Reference Manual for details.
     * QSIM-53110 - (source) The behavior of the vsim command "profile
       option " has been made consistent for all options. Issuing this
       command will display the status of the specified option -- this
       command will no longer toggle the value of the specified option
       (use "profile option on|off" to set the value of the option).

   Qwave logging Compatibility
     * VISU-4192 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in
       the Qwave wavefile. Now they are.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-35502 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being
       printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of
       real types in VCD.
     * QSIM-41547 - An issue related to licensing is fixed. The issue
       caused a hang if the checked-out license feature is about to expire
       (default is 15 days before expiration). A workaround was to set the
       'MGLS_EXP_WARN_DAYS' variable to '1'. Now, the workaround is not
       needed. This issue was not applicable to Windows platform.
     * QSIM-24925 - Input-to-Input SDF INTERCONNECT delays are not
       annotated in optimized vsim run when there is not any driver on the
       high connection net.
     * QSIM-52009 - Fixed an issue where tool was crashing while printing
       capstats report with -du option. The issue was related to variable
       declarations inside fork..join.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-53662 - For certain signal widths the column width was being
       miscalculated which resulted in '*' being displayed in place of an
       actual value. The correct width is now being calculated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-4784 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one
       element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are
       different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases where a fork..join block contained a
       nested fork..join_any sub-block, disabling the outer block would
       not immediately disable the inner block.
     * [nodvtid] - Vopt would sometimes crash in designs with interfaces
       that imported complex types from packages.
     * QSIM-30243 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-9374 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-7336 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-9963 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function
       calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a
       $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant
       (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a
       fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result
       of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver
       during a randomize call.
     * QSIM-4229 - In some rare cases, randomize() would fail with the
       following spurious error message: "Invalid random variable in index
       expression for constraint" -- even in cases where an index
       expression only referred to constant (non-random) variables. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-23582 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-4891 - Converted simulation time warning "vsim-3839" to a
       suppressible error. vsim-3839 is reported when a variable driven
       via port connection and is multiply driven.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The SystemVerilog 'iff' property operator now
       associates to the right. IEEE 1800-2017 table 16-3.
     * QSIM-18847 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger an
       internal error related to an interaction between random dynamic
       arrays and pre_randomize. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-19967 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle
       was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all
       shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG
       (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results
       of a call to the shuffle method. In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG
       selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
       +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
       -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle
       method The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim. For
       backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled
       (-thrdrngshfl)
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are
       present.
     * [nodvtid] - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&&
       and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV
       HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions.
       Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.
     * QSIM-50272 - The vencrypt feature "-auto3protect" could not
       properly handle macro call syntax in the port list of a module.
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.
     * QSIM-51616 - Intertial delay was not working properly for
       tranif/rtranif primitives with delay when the control/enable input
       had multiple transitions within the delay period.
     * QSIM-52696 - In some cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating
       an array.size() constraint for a random dynamic array of real type.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-52457 - (results) Added an error check when class types are
       not assignable under -pedanticerrors.
     * QSIM-33083 - (results) Questa used to report an error on
       referencing tasks/functions defined later in the compilation unit
       scope. This is now fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-27418 - Special characters in a comment that was inside an
       encrypted region could cause a parsing error.
     * QSIM-2261 - An internal error was report in some cases in vcom or
       vopt if an array signal is indexed or sliced. The index expression
       or slice expression contains a locally static expression that has a
       primary is a record or array. For example:
constant C : integer_vector(0 to 1) := ( 3, 6);
signal   S : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
....
   o <= S(C(0)); -- The use of C(0) can cause an internal error

     * QSIM-16902 - If a package contains a generic of the same name as a
       generic of an entity, and the package is instantiated within the
       entity, the compiler may incorrectly use the static value of the
       entity's generic rather than the package's generic when producing
       code for the package instantiation.
     * QSIM-39177 - A simulator crash could occur if an object was
       declared with an initial expression that was the name of another
       object whose initial value was a function call whose return type
       mark was the predefined attribute SUBTYPE with a prefix that was
       one of the function input parameters (when that parameter is of an
       unconstrained composite type).
     * QSIM-42988 - Reference to a package constant defined within a
       package instance that is itself defined within a simple package
       could cause the compiler to produce an internal error.
     * QSIM-6762 - The compiler could crash when encountering a composite
       assignment, where the left-hand side contains a variable whose type
       is an interface type.
     * QSIM-15169 - The vcom compiler "-just" and "-skip" options now
       allow the specification 'x', which means VHDL 2008 "context"
       declarations.
     * QSIM-28023 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked
       processes, forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation
       results. This has been fixed now.
     * QSIM-5497 - For some specific cases of type conversions used in the
       unbound components, vsim used to crash. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-10698 - The verilog reserved word "global" was not supported
       in VHDL packages with -mixedsvvh switch. This has been supported
       now.
     * VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents
       of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not
       included. Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are
       also excluded. Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed"
       are filtered out of logging.
     * QSIM-43580 - A port association that is an aggregate with an OTHERS
       choice, for a constrained port that is an array-of-array, and where
       those constraints are globally static, could result in either a
       compiler internal error or a run-time simulator error about
       mismatched array lengths.
     * QSIM-50516 - In some case vopt generate an internal error or bad
       code for a configuration. This would occur if a generic or port of
       a component being configuration was used anywhere other than the
       port/generic map.
     * QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is
       connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output
       was incorrect. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-3588 - For some specific cases of for generates, vsim use to
       crash. This has been fixed.
     * QSIM-53077 - In a protected type body, if there was a data member
       whose subtype involved another data member's value, then bad code,
       which would crash the simulator, would result.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-1380 - vopt crashes caused due to linking in
       libsystemc_gccXX.a into the intermediate shared library during the
       'sccom -linkshared' step has been fixed.
     * QSIM-51654 - scparse compilation failures with the nlohmann JSON
       c++ code has been fixed
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-12536 - Fixed a bug where assertion severity system tasks were
       not getting overridden when -systfoverride switch was specified.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-53075 - (results) When passing a Verilog unpacked array to a
       VHDL array generic, values were mapped from the, Verilog value at
       the low index was mapped to the VHDL position with the left index.
       parameter int val[3:0] when passed to generic g1 :
       integer_array(3:0) would map val[0] => g1(3), val[1] => g1(2),
       val[2] => g1(1), val[3]=>g1(0). Now the values are passed like
       val[0] => g1[0], val[1] => g1(1), val[2] => g1(2), and val[3] =>
       g1(3).
     * QSIM-2330 - A "force -deposit" on a VHDL signal connected to an SV
       inout port immediately reverted back to its original value even
       though there were no subsequent driver events.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * VM-9403 - Fixed an infinite-loop bug in the VRM HTML report
       generator's RMDB expansion algorithm which would occur when a
       usertcl procedure implementing a "foreach" parameter tried to
       expand another parameter.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM where FetchEventUcdbs build-in utility
       procedure could return incorrect paths.
     * VM-8783 - Fixed bug where "-inputsfile" option to "triage passfail"
       command wasn't being recognized.
     * VM-8513 - Fixed bug where "-exitcode" command-line option was not
       producing a non-zero exit code if the regression run had tests
       which timed out. The fix also includes producing a non-zero exit
       code in the event a test is killed (by the user) or dropped
       (possibly due to a VRM bug).
     * VM-10665 - Fixed bug where a runnable whose base attribute
       contained multiple runnable names separated by commas would result
       in an error when run through the RMDB sanity checker ("-checkrmdb"
       command-line option).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * QSIM-10802 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption
       of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those
       always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are
       non-synthesizable. Users will be notified with a warning message
       (vopt-9031) whenever such blocks are ignored. To enable corruption
       for such always blocks use the vopt option
       -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.
     * QSIM-28733 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated - 1- parse the
       liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to
       option -pa_libertyfiles 2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is
       provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files,
       then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file
     * [nodvtid] - For PA Coverage report the new reports support PA
       checks and PA Power States. Whereas, for PA/non-PA combined
       coverage report, the new reports Only support PA Power States in
       addition to all known normal Coverage types.
     * QSIM-9086 - Earlier if an interface port in RTL is specified in upf
       connect_supply_net command to connect interface port with upf
       supply net then vopt was giving error because it was not supported.
       After this fix interface port in upf connect_supply_net is
       supported.
     * QSIM-56 - For all types of objects, tool now does the coverage
       consistently in terms of illegal states being marked as
       illegal_bins. By default tool does not include undefined state in
       coverage if -complete it not given. If -complete is specified
       undefined state is covered as illegal_bin
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Qwave logging Defects Repaired in 2019.1
     * VISU-4192 - (results) Some VHDL boolean signals were not logged in
       the Qwave wavefile. Now they are.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 2019.1
     * [nodvtid] - -stats=perf+verbose will now print additional section
       about the machine and OS environment, where executable is run. This
       is available in all executables, which support -stats option.
 Machine Details
     Host: mach1.mentorg.com (SGE grid)
       OS: CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)

     * [nodvtid] - (results) Added enhancement to show warning 3040 in
       vopt for non existent parameters in design given with -G. Warnings
       are shown only for parameters whose path gets resolved in vopt. If
       there is a pdu in vopt design unit, warnings will be deferred to
       vsim. For foreign generics, which are added later in vsim in
       design, there will be warnings in vopt if -G is used in vopt. For
       small test: module top; parameter p = 1; initial $display(p);
       endmodule For command "vsim -c top -Gpr=3", warning 3040 will be
       shown in vopt, in place of vsim: ** Warning: (vopt-3040) Command
       line generic/parameter "pr" not found in design.
     * QSIM-879 - Added support for matching bit-blasted scalar port in
       rtl with normal non-escaped port names in SDF under switch
       "-sdfallowvlogescapeport".
     * QSIM-244 - Added support for reading and writing capstats database.
       The database can be written using command 'capstats -save
       file_name' and it can be read back in post simulation mode using
       command 'capstats -open filename'. The capstats reports can be
       printed after reading in the capstats database. This database does
       not store object names from the protected code.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 2019.1
     * QSIM-1762 - (source) The user interface for the solver profiler has
       been integrated into the vsim profiling commands. The vsim
       command-line option of "-solveprofile" has been deprecated. Use
       "vsim -autoprofile" or the vsim command "profile on" to enable vsim
       and solver profiling Use the "profile report -solver" vsim command
       to print the solver profile report. See the QuestaSim User Manual
       and Command Reference Manual for details.
     * QSIM-53110 - (source) The behavior of the vsim command "profile
       option " has been made consistent for all options. Issuing this
       command will display the status of the specified option -- this
       command will no longer toggle the value of the specified option
       (use "profile option on|off" to set the value of the option).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 2019.1
     * QSIM-10245 - For C/C++ auto compile, modelsim.ini variable
       "DpiCppInstall" has been added which is the equivalent of the
       '-dpicppinstall' command line option.
     * QSIM-10245 -
The '-cppinstall' and '-cpppath' options will be honored for C/C++ auto compile
in the absence of '-dpicppinstall' and '-dpicpppath' options.
For SystemC compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path is
 the following:
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath
For C/C++ auto compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path
 is the following:
- -dpicppinstall
- -dpicpppath
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath

     * QSIM-23017 -
Warning numbers 7076 and 7077 for vlog and vsim  have been upgraded to suppressi
ble errors. They will now appear as:
** Error (suppressible): (<TOOL>-7076) The gcc/g++ path '<path specified>' via -
dpicppinstall swicth is not qualified and is ignored.
** Error (suppressible): (<TOOL>-7077) the path '<path specified>' via -dpicpppa
th switch not a valid gcc/g++ full path and is ignored.
vlog/vsim -suppress 7076 | 7077 to suppress the error.

     * QSIM-30463 - Add vlog/vopt -svinputport=compat option to default an
       input port declared with a type but without the "var" keyword to
       "wire", as required by the LRM, but only if the type is compatible
       with a net declaration. The fully LRM compliant option
       -svinputport=net will default to "wire" even if the type is not
       compatible with a net declaration ("bit", for example), potentially
       resulting in compilation errors. The default behavior remains
       unchanged, which is -svinputport=relaxed, where only a a type that
       is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single dimension vector type
       defaults to "wire".
     * QSIM-27977 - For implicit vopt (2-step) flow, detailed -stats
       output can now be obtained by passing required -stats=* option to
       -voptargs="" along with -vopt_verbose option in vsim.
     * QSIM-4103 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed
       structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of
       a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
       The support has been added as default and will be an error with
       -pedanticerrors.
     * QSIM-38134 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt
       -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an
       IfElse constraint with constant condition.
       By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is
       triggered.
       vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to
       the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if
       solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
       When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant,
       a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.

     * QSIM-3584 - Added a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language
       extension to enable "strict" random stability in the solver.
       "Strict" random stability guarantees that two instances of the same
       class, having the same randstate, will generate the same
       randomize() results -- regardless of the order in which the
       randomize() calls are made and independent of any randomize() calls
       that are made before them. Enable "strict" random stability with
       the vsim command line option "-svrandext=+strictstab". Enabling
       "strict" random stability can negatively impact randomize()
       performance for some scenarios. This extension is disabled by
       default.
     * QSIM-32714 - (results) The behavior of SolveFailDebug (for
       SystemVerilog randomize() calls) has been changed. Enabling
       SolveFailDebug will only generate a constraint contradiction report
       for randomize() calls that fail due to having no solutions when
       SolveFailSeverity is set to a non-zero value. In addition, the
       default value of the following vsim modelsim.ini variables has been
       changed: - SolveFailDebug: change to 1 (basic debug enabled) from 0
       (off) - SolveFailSeverity: change to 1 (warning) from 0 (no
       message)
     * [nodvtid] - (source) Vsim switch -assertcover option is deprecated
       now. Using -assertcover in vsim command line generates
       'vsimk-16036' suppressible error. Assertion coverage is available
       by default. If various assertion counts are required, switch
       -assertcounts may be used.
     * [nodvtid] - Added SV extension -svext=alpo, to allow overriding the
       local parameters using -G switch in vopt. It cannot be used to
       override class parameters.
     * QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini
       files and deprecated warning message.
     * QSIM-13999 - Added support for same name interface in multiple
       libraries. Before fix if we use two virtual interface of same type
       name but in different libraries (virtual interfaces used in their
       corresponding libraries) we used to get either wrong result or
       crash. This has been fixed now.
     * QSIM-34560 - Added support for assignment pattern on LHS for
       variable type elements.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Xprop assertions has been disabled by default
       in pass and resolve mode. The user has to provide vopt option
       "-xprop,report={severity}" to enable the assertions in pass and
       resolve mode.

   VHDL Enhancements in 2019.1
     * QSIM-43418 - Designs that have a very large number of signals that
       are either multidimensional arrays or arrays whose elements are
       arrays or records will now load faster at simulation time.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Enhancements in 2019.1
     * QSIM-498 - (source, results) SystemC support has been upgraded to
       SystemC-2.3.2 from SystemC-2.3.1. Please refer to the SystemC
       Simulation chapter in the user's manual for SystemC-2.3.2
       incompatibilities with SystemC-2.3.1.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Mixed Language Enhancements in 2019.1
     * QSIM-53671 - VHDL can now instantiate a Verilog module that has a
       multi-dimensional packed array-of-array-of-reg array port, when the
       actual connected to that port is a VHDL array port (as long as the
       number of scalar subelements matches).
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 2019.1
     * VM-2476 - Added "-minmerge", "-mintriage", "-mergewait", and
       "-triagewait" command-line options to vrun for fine-grained control
       of queued auto-merge function.
     * VM-7029 - VRM testlist improvements:
          + If the first token on a non-comment testlist line is "include"
            and is followed by a second non-integer token, the second
            token is treated as a path name (absolute or relative to the
            directory where the parent file is located) and the referenced
            file is opened and recursively parsed as a nested testlist.
          + If the first (test name) token on two or more lines in a
            testlist are identical, the tests generated by those lines are
            combined into a single repeat list under that test name.

   Power Aware Enhancements in 2019.1
     * QSIM-20422 - (source) Added a suppressible error (9032) for cases -
       when ack port is already driven in HDL and because of which tool
       will not dump any drivers for the ack port. Earlier this
       information was dumped in a report file. This change will not
       impact the results but users might have to suppress this error if
       issued.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Change in behavior of Balloon-style level
       sensitive retention protocol: Previous tool retention behavior is
       to transfer the retained value on the register at the leading edge
       of the restore event (if the restore_condition is high). This has
       been changed to make the behavior LRM compliant. Now the tool will
       transfer the retained value on the register at the trailing edge of
       the restore_event (when restore_condition is high). User can get
       the old behavior using the option -pa_disable=trailingedgerestore
     * QSIM-20027 - (results) Added the support to report the switching
       activity of VHDL Enum and VHDL Boolean in "power report" command.
       This is enabled with "power add -vhdlint" option.
     * QSIM-197 - (source, results) The following changes were updated in
       the HDL package functions to align them with UPF LRM 3.1:
         1. Added support for singleton class object upfDesignT.
         2. Added field current_simstate on native UPF object upfPdSsObjT
            to fetch current simstate of power domains or supply sets.
         3. Type definition of upfHandleT has been changed from chandle to
            SV int.
       Now we strictly follow the LRM guideline, which says that the
       handles to properties and iterators may be reused and are not valid
       for comparison.
     * QSIM-35670 - (source, results) Improved hier path parsing in UPF
       file.
     * QSIM-42 - Questa PA now has support for power aware apps based on
       PA Information Model which can be used for the purpose of debug,
       reporting and checking of the design.
     * QSIM-144 - Tool now supports power state semantics based on UPF 3.0
       LRM.
     * QSIM-50691 - Tool now support power states groups along with their
       coverage.
     * QSIM-26929 - Under vopt option -pa_enable=resolvedsubnet, when
       there are multiple drivers and resolved nets in a connected network
       tool will collect all drivers of that network and drive all the
       resolved nets with common resolution function.
     * QSIM-19603 - (results) PA reports: report.upf.txt and
       report.mspa.txt will no longer be generated. Currently,
       report.pa.txt and report.de.txt provide all data used to be
       reported in the removed reports.
     * QSIM-7 - (results) Reduced the number of vopt options for PA. Some
       of the options have been made default and some have been
       deprecated.
       Three kinds of messages have been introduced for PA options
       cleanup:

     If the option has been made default, you will get the following
     warning:

     **Warning: (vopt-9033) Option -pa_upfextensions=xyz has been made
     default and will be deleted in next release.

     If the option has been deleted, you will get the following error:

     **Error (suppressible) : (vopt-9034) Option -pa_upfextensions=xyz
     has been deprecated and will be ignored.

     If the option has been modified, you will get the following warning:

     **Warning: (vopt-9035) Option "-pa_upfextensions=xyz" will be
     deprecated from next release. Use "-pa_xyz" instead.

     * QSIM-6965 - (source, results)
       Support of NOR style and NAND style isolation cells according to
       UPF 3.0
     * QSIM-153 - (results) Added support to connect 3 PG pin ELS cells -
       earlier the cell were connected based on different rules. hence
       results will change
     * QSIM-16967 - (results) enhanced PA connection reports to show
       connection type along with connected net.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The assertion control option
       "-pa_enable=forceasrtoffpwrdown" has been improved to honor user's
       assertion control system task(e.g asserton, assertoff, assertkill)
       once the assertion is out of power down period.
       The assertions will remain disabled during power off period
       irrespective of any user assertion control system task.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) A new option
       "-pa_enable=donttouchassertinbind" has been introduced to keep the
       assertions unaffected due to power down/power up in bind
       hierarchies.
     * QSIM-840 - (source, results) Instantaneously corrupting the value
       of LHS in delayed continuos assignment on power down.

   MC2 Enhancements in 2019.1
     * VISU-7551 - Introducing wavedir command in vsim and visualizer for
       MC2 flow. The command creates a qwave dataset to be read in
       visualizer. The command syntax is vsim ... -qwavedb=+wavedir=
        ... vis ..... -wavedir
