<p /><a name="keyinfo"></a><font size="5"><b>Key Information</b></font>
<ul><li>The vlog -wireasinterconnect option is deprecated due to performance issues, and a warning message is issued to that effect when used. The vopt -rnmautointeconnect option is preferred because it takes advantage of the vopt analysis to more selectively convert wires to interconnect. Only wires connected upwards from real/wreal/nettype/interconnect ports are converted.</li>
 <li>QSIM-140 - (results) The compiler +protect flow is in process of deprecation. This affects the vlog and vcom compilers. The recommended flow is to use vencrypt (Verilog/SV) or vhencrypt (VHDL) followed by vlog or vcom compilation. The deprecation process starts with a warning if this option is used, which will become an error in later releases.
The reason for this change is to remove the source ambiguities referenced by the compilation libraries. An encrypted compilation is a compilation of the post-encryption sources and must not retain any association with pre-encryption sources. This principle is reinforced by maintaining a two-step flow.</li>
 <li>QSIM-1683 - Note-3865 has been replaced with non-suppressible Warning-3865 and message has also been updated.

<pre>
** Warning: (vsim-3865) Due to PLI being present, global +acc is being enabled automatically. This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. Please use vsim -no_autoacc to disable this feature. This feature is now deprecated and will be removed from future releases.
</pre> 

Users should not rely on tool to automatically add global +acc for visibility in 2-step flow with PLI. It is recommended that users specify -no_autoacc vsim option and provide targeted +acc setting or TAB file for require PLI visibility.</li>
 <li><p>
There is no licensing change between 10.7 and 2019.1. However, if you are migrating to 2019.1 from a release like 10.6 and older, please note that release 2019.1 uses FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 <li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 <li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 <li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
</li>
 <li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 2019.1 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>

</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-4784 - (source) The width of lhs and rhs must be same for one element assignment patterns (rc = '{clk}), incase they are different vopt shall give suppressible error 13174.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) An issue with incorrect precedence in the &&& and "matches" operations in SV has been fixed. This may cause SV HDL code to be compiled differently than with previous versions. Any differences will be flagged by the compiler with an error.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source) Vsim switch -assertcover option is deprecated now. Using -assertcover in vsim command line generates 'vsimk-16036' suppressible error. Assertion coverage is available by default. If various assertion counts are required, switch -assertcounts may be used.</li>
 <li>QSIM-38134 - (source, results) Added a SV extension vlog/vopt -svext=[+-]ifslvbefr to allow solve/before constraint within an IfElse constraint with constant condition. 
<br>
By default, this extension is on and no compile-time check is triggered.
<br>
vlog/vopt -pedanticerrors or -svext=-ifslvbefr will revert back to the legacy behavior. A compile error (vlog-2919) will be thrown if solve/before constraint is under an IfElse constraint.
<br>
When the condition expression of IfElse constraint is NOT constant, a new runtime error (vsim-16056) will be thrown, i.e.

<pre>
Error: (vsim-16056) ../src/iter1b.sv(11): Illegal use of solve/before
constraint in conditional/implication constraint context.
</pre>
</li>
 <li>QSIM-30243 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints, -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-9374 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple 'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>QSIM-7336 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-9963 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver during a randomize call.</li>
 <li>QSIM-23582 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize() for the same class type and randstate would generate different results. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) The SystemVerilog 'iff' property operator now associates to the right. IEEE 1800-2017 table 16-3.</li>
 <li>QSIM-19967 - (results) The array manipulation method array.shuffle was modified to use the RNG of the active thread. Previously all shuffle operations shared a separate internal RNG (RandomNumberGenerator). The change in RNG can change the results of a call to the shuffle method.
In 10.7x and 10.6x the RNG selection is controlled by the -svext=[+-]thrdrngshfl option.
  +thrdrngshfl : the thread RNG is used by the shuffle method
  -thrdrngshfl : the separate internal RNG is used by the shuffle method
The -svext option applies to both vlog and vsim.
For backward compatibility, by default the option is disabled (-thrdrngshfl)
</li>
 <li>QSIM-17634 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are present.</li>
 <li>QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.</li>
 <li>QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional evaluation behavior.</li>
 <li>QSIM-52457 - (results) Added an error check when class types are not assignable under -pedanticerrors.</li>
 <li>QSIM-33083 - (results) Questa used to report an error on referencing tasks/functions defined later in the compilation unit scope. This is now fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-4103 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
The support has been added as default and will be an error with -pedanticerrors.  </li>
 <li>QSIM-32714 - (results) The behavior of SolveFailDebug (for SystemVerilog randomize() calls) has been changed. Enabling SolveFailDebug will only generate a constraint contradiction report for randomize() calls that fail due to having no solutions when SolveFailSeverity is set to a non-zero value.

In addition, the default value of the following vsim modelsim.ini variables has been changed:
  - SolveFailDebug: change to 1 (basic debug enabled) from 0 (off)
  - SolveFailSeverity: change to 1 (warning) from 0 (no message)

</li>
 <li>QSIM-36896 - (results) Removed read of NoAutoSDFCompile from .ini files and deprecated warning message.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Xprop assertions has been disabled by default in pass and resolve mode. The user has to provide vopt option "-xprop,report={severity}" to enable the assertions in pass and resolve mode.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-28023 - (results) For some specific cases of clocked processes, forcing the signal used to give incorrect simulation results. This has been fixed now.</li>
 <li>VISU-4153 - (results) When logging VHDL to a qwave file, contents of standard IEEE packages, like stdlogic and numeric_std are not included.  Now packaged like fixed_pkg and float_generic_pkg are also excluded.  Standard packages beginning with "float" or "fixed" are filtered out of logging.

</li>
 <li>QSIM-50659 - (results) In certain cases where an actual is connected to multiple formals of a procedure, the simulation output was incorrect. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-53075 - (results) When passing a Verilog unpacked array to a VHDL array generic, values were mapped from the, Verilog value at the low index was mapped to the VHDL position with the left index.  parameter int val[3:0]  when passed to generic g1 : integer_array(3:0) would map val[0] => g1(3), val[1] => g1(2), val[2] => g1(1), val[3]=>g1(0).  Now the values are passed like val[0] => g1[0], val[1] => g1(1), val[2] => g1(2), and val[3] => g1(3).</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Power Aware  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-20422 - (source) Added a suppressible error (9032) for cases  - when ack port is already driven in HDL and because of which tool will not dump any drivers for the ack port. Earlier this information was dumped in a report file. This change will not impact the results but users might have to suppress this error if issued.</li>
 <li>QSIM-197 - (source, results) The following changes were updated in the HDL package functions to align them with UPF LRM 3.1:<br>
<ol>
<li>Added support for singleton class object upfDesignT.
<li>Added field current_simstate on native UPF object upfPdSsObjT to fetch current simstate of power domains or supply sets.
<li>Type definition of upfHandleT has been changed from chandle to SV int.
</ol>
<p>
Now we strictly follow the LRM guideline, which says that the handles to properties and iterators may be reused and are not valid for comparison.
</li>
 <li>QSIM-35670 - (source, results)  Improved hier path parsing in UPF file.</li>
 <li>QSIM-6965 - (source, results) <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Support of NOR style and NAND style isolation cells
according to UPF 3.0<o:p></o:p></span></p></li>
 <li>QSIM-840 - (source, results) Instantaneously corrupting the value of LHS in delayed continuos assignment on power down.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-10802 - (results) By-default QuestaSim will ignore corruption of behavioral sequential blocks. Behavioral Sequential are those always blocks which has edge sensitivity but they are non-synthesizable. Users will be notified with a warning message (vopt-9031) whenever such blocks are ignored. To enable corruption for such always blocks use the vopt option -pa_enable=behaveseqcrpt.</li>
 <li>QSIM-28733 - (results) Liberty parsing is updated -  
1- parse the liberty files in the same order in which the files are provided to option -pa_libertyfiles
2- When option -pa_libertyupdate is provided, and there are same libraries in different liberty files, then the library will be overridden by the last parsed liberty file</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Change in behavior of Balloon-style level sensitive retention protocol: 

Previous tool retention behavior is to transfer the retained value on the register at the leading edge of the restore event (if the restore_condition is high). This has been changed to make the behavior LRM compliant. Now the tool will transfer the retained value on the register at the trailing edge of the restore_event (when restore_condition is high). 
User can get the old behavior using the option -pa_disable=trailingedgerestore</li>
 <li>QSIM-20027 - (results) Added the support to report the switching activity of VHDL Enum and VHDL Boolean in "power report" command. This is enabled with "power add -vhdlint" option.</li>
 <li>QSIM-19603 - (results) PA reports: report.upf.txt and report.mspa.txt will no longer be generated.
Currently, report.pa.txt and report.de.txt provide all data used to be reported in the removed reports.</li>
 <li>QSIM-7 - (results) Reduced the number of vopt options for PA. Some of the options have been made default and some have been deprecated.<br />Three kinds of messages have been introduced for PA options cleanup:<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">If the option has been made default, you will get the following warning:<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">**Warning: (vopt-9033) Option -pa_upfextensions=xyz has been made default and will be deleted in next release.</blockquote>If the option has been deleted, you will get the following error:<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">**Error (suppressible) : (vopt-9034) Option -pa_upfextensions=xyz has been deprecated and will be ignored.</blockquote>If the option has been modified, you will get the following warning:<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div>**Warning: (vopt-9035) Option &quot;-pa_upfextensions=xyz&quot; will be deprecated from next release. Use &quot;-pa_xyz&quot; instead.</div></blockquote></blockquote></li>
 <li>QSIM-153 - (results) Added support to connect 3 PG pin ELS cells - earlier the cell were connected based on different rules. hence results will change<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-16967 - (results) enhanced PA connection reports to show connection type along with connected net.<br /></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) The  assertion control option &quot;-pa_enable=forceasrtoffpwrdown&quot; has been improved to honor user's assertion control system task(e.g asserton, assertoff, assertkill) once the assertion is out of power down period. <br />The assertions will remain disabled during power off period irrespective of any user assertion control system task.<br /></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) A new option &quot;-pa_enable=donttouchassertinbind&quot; has been introduced to keep the assertions unaffected  due to power down/power up in bind hierarchies. <br /></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-35502 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of real types in VCD. </li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) Added enhancement to show warning 3040 in vopt for non existent parameters in design given with -G.
Warnings are shown only for parameters whose path gets resolved in vopt. If there is a pdu in vopt design unit, warnings will be deferred to vsim. For foreign generics, which are added later in vsim in design, there will be warnings in vopt if -G is used in vopt.

For small test:
module top;
	parameter p = 1;
	initial $display(p);
endmodule

For command "vsim -c top -Gpr=3", warning 3040 will be shown in vopt, in place of vsim:
** Warning: (vopt-3040) Command line generic/parameter "pr" not found in design.

</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemC  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-498 - (source, results) SystemC support has been upgraded to SystemC-2.3.2 from SystemC-2.3.1. Please refer to the SystemC Simulation chapter in the user's manual for SystemC-2.3.2 incompatibilities with SystemC-2.3.1.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>User Interface  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-1762 - (source) The user interface for the solver profiler has been integrated into the vsim profiling commands.
The vsim command-line option  of &quot;-solveprofile&quot; has been deprecated. 
 Use &quot;vsim -autoprofile&quot; or the vsim command &quot;profile on&quot; to enable vsim and solver profiling
Use the &quot;profile report -solver&quot; vsim command to print the solver profile report.
See the QuestaSim User Manual and Command Reference Manual for details.
</li>
 <li>QSIM-53110 - (source) The behavior of the vsim command &quot;profile option <opt>&quot; has been made consistent for all options. Issuing this command will display the status of the specified option <opt> -- this command will no longer toggle the value of the specified option (use &quot;profile option <opt> on|off&quot; to set the value of the option).</opt></opt></opt></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Qwave logging  Compatibility</b></font></dd>

 <li>QSIM-9963 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant (non-random) value.

 <li>QSIM-30463 - Add vlog/vopt -svinputport=compat option to default an input port declared with a type but without the "var" keyword to "wire", as required by the LRM, but only if the type is compatible with a net declaration. The fully LRM compliant option -svinputport=net will default to "wire" even if the type is not compatible with a net declaration ("bit", for example), potentially resulting in compilation errors. The default behavior remains unchanged, which is -svinputport=relaxed, where only a a type that is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single dimension vector type defaults to "wire".</li>

"Strict" random stability guarantees that two instances of the same class, having the same randstate, will generate the same randomize() results -- regardless of the order in which the randomize() calls are made and independent of any randomize() calls that are made before them. Enable "strict" random stability with the vsim command line option "-svrandext=+strictstab". Enabling "strict" random stability can negatively impact randomize() performance for some scenarios.
