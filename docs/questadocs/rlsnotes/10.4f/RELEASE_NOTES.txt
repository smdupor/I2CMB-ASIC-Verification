   Key Information
     * [nodvtid] - The 10.4g Update Release will be the last release in
       the 10.4 series
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Release Announcements in 10.4f
     * [nodvtid] -
       [10.4] Support for Windows XP and Windows Vista has been
       discontinued.
       [10.4] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.4.
       However if you are migrating to 10.4 from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.4f

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt87030 - (results) Force/Release on loconn was not handled
       properly in case of cell optimization, causing a simulation
       mismatch when run without +acc=c
     * dvt85937 - (results) Fixed the issues that DPI disable protocol was
       not followed when a thread is terminated either by "disable fork"
       or "process:kill"
     * dvt87351 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail
       with a spurious constraint contradiction related to an interaction
       between constraints involving array.size expressions and if-else
       constraints having a logical-and implicant/alternate constraint.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt85666 - (results) In some cases, randomize() involving array.sum
       constraints would generate poor solution distributions on the
       random elements of array. This issue has been fixed.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fixed a bug in Questa's support of nested
       classes. Extending a nested class whose parent class is
       parameterised was not supported. This has been supported now. For
       example , the following example now works :
class base#(int A = 1);
    class base_inner;
    endclass
endclass

class derived#(int A = 1) extends base#(A);
      class derived_inner extends base_inner;
      endclass
endclass


     * dvt82320 - (results) Fixed a bug in supporting class
       specializations which are based on associative arrays using a wild
       card (*) For example the following now works correctly.
class A#(type T = int);
endclass
class B;
typedef bit abc[*];
A#(abc) a;
endclass

     * dvt87755 - (results) Stop giving warning vsim-SDF-8745 for valid
       retain Values. Support enhanced to take care of null values.
     * dvt89119 - (results) In GUI mode, the VSIM "restart" command would
       ignore a specified "-sv_seed " option if "-f" is not also
       specified. This issue has been fixed.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where
       both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give
       an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of
       association element". This has been fixed.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report
       (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first
       10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked.
       Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= <i
       >'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith
       tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch
       '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the
       bin will be reported.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt87784 - (results) The cover directive coverage number reported
       within some summary reports has been fixed. This number is
       'coverage by instance'. In some cases is was being reported as the
       sum of 'coverage by instance' and 'coverage by DU'.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.4f
     * dvt87174 - Using vsim option -title inside a -f file will result in
       an error.
     * dvt87144 - An error is produced when attempting to use the fixed
       point radix types in a post-sim mode. This issue has been resolved.
     * [nodvtid] - When a library is mapped using an environment variable,
       adding signals to the schematic window would fail.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.4f
     * dvt87030 - (results) Force/Release on loconn was not handled
       properly in case of cell optimization, causing a simulation
       mismatch when run without +acc=c
     * dvt85937 - (results) Fixed the issues that DPI disable protocol was
       not followed when a thread is terminated either by "disable fork"
       or "process:kill"
     * dvt86203 - Fix a crash in vsim when automatic variables for a class
       are declared within an if-then-else statement with a fork/join and
       wait.
     * dvt87256 - Fixed a bug which resulted in vsim time fatal error when
       with clause is used with streaming concat operator.
     * dvt87351 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail
       with a spurious constraint contradiction related to an interaction
       between constraints involving array.size expressions and if-else
       constraints having a logical-and implicant/alternate constraint.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt85666 - (results) In some cases, randomize() involving array.sum
       constraints would generate poor solution distributions on the
       random elements of array. This issue has been fixed.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fixed a bug in Questa's support of nested
       classes. Extending a nested class whose parent class is
       parameterised was not supported. This has been supported now. For
       example , the following example now works :
class base#(int A = 1);
    class base_inner;
    endclass
endclass

class derived#(int A = 1) extends base#(A);
      class derived_inner extends base_inner;
      endclass
endclass


     * dvt87658 - The vsim command "write report -solver " will now
       redirect the output of the solver report to the specified .
     * dvt87420 - Fixed a crash in vsim in a corner scenario. If we have a
       module say top and some signal is passed to an interface from this
       module, which is further passed to another interface instantiated
       in first interface. Then due to some internal optimization we were
       getting a crash in vsim. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt87382 - Allowed the syntax when modports are declared starting
       with attribute_instance. Below syntax is now supported.
       Modport_ports_declaration ::= { attribute_instance }
       modport_simple_ports_declaration | { attribute_instance }
       modport_tf_ports_declaration | { attribute_instance }
       modport_clocking_declaration
     * dvt82320 - (results) Fixed a bug in supporting class
       specializations which are based on associative arrays using a wild
       card (*) For example the following now works correctly.
class A#(type T = int);
endclass
class B;
typedef bit abc[*];
A#(abc) a;
endclass

     * dvt87755 - (results) Stop giving warning vsim-SDF-8745 for valid
       retain Values. Support enhanced to take care of null values.
     * dvt88260 - The sensitivity extracted for @* was incorrect in some
       cases.
     * dvt88550 - In some rare cases, running vsim with the
       -solvefaildebug switch enabled would cause an internal error during
       randomize(). This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt89119 - (results) In GUI mode, the VSIM "restart" command would
       ignore a specified "-sv_seed " option if "-f" is not also
       specified. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt89597 - Fixed an internal error during randomize().
     * dvt89423 - Fixed a bug where non-blocking assignment to a clocking
       block output was getting ignored in some cases if more than one
       non-blocking assignments were being happening during same clock
       cycle and output has an event based skew.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.4f
     * dvt86918 - When an inner nested GENERATE block contained a slice
       name whose slice range depended in an outer FOR-GENERATE's loop
       parameter, and when a component instantiation in the inner GENERATE
       contained a GENERIC MAP association element that had an actual that
       depended on this slice name, then the compiler would create bad
       code that could crash the simulator.
     * dvt86935 - Fixed a crash where a VHDL port which is an array of
       std_logic, the actual of the port is a slice of a static expression
       and the port is connected to a Verilog port.
     * dvt86813 - A CASE GENERATE statement that contained an external
       name in the expression or in a choice in an alternative would
       sometimes cause a simulator crash.
     * dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where
       both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give
       an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of
       association element". This has been fixed.
     * dvt35748 - When +cover was specified to vcom, implicit operators
       were included in the set of subprograms that were added to the
       Structure window in the GUI, along with user-defined subprograms.
       Implicit operators are no longer part of this set.
     * dvt89183 - Concatenation expressions involving a qualified
       expression whose operand was also a concatenation expression could
       sometimes cause a vcom internal error.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.4f
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed DPI and SystemC link time errors due to different
       standard library installation paths on some linux distributions.
       Library paths looked up at link time will be "/usr/lib64",
       "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu" for 64-bit and
       "/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu", "/usr/lib/i686-linux-gnu", "/usr/lib32"
       for 32-bit platforms
     * dvt86850 - In certain scenarios, where systemc.so would not unload
       during shared library cleanup and the design has global SystemC
       objects, vopt or vsim may crash at exit time trying to print an
       error message. This issue is now fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.4f
     * dvt87719 - Fixed a bug where sometimes vsim was crashing after
       restart if the design had procedural concurrent assertions.
     * dvt89114 - Fixed a bug where filter option in some of the assertion
       commands was not working for immediate assertions. This prevented
       users to select only XPROP assertions. An XPROP bug has also been
       fixed to make this work for the XPROP assertions.
     * dvt89440 - Assertion evaluation was wrong when there were multiple
       instances of sequence.matched.
     * dvt89182 - vsim crashes in some cases when an assertion with
       boolean property had a pass action block.
     * dvt90293 - $past(v,n) gives incorrect initial values when n is
       greater than 1.
     * dvt90240 - Fixed a bug where immediate assertions in functions were
       consuming high memory if they had return statement in the action
       block.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.4f
     * [nodvtid] - VRM example, sorting coverage information based on
       status, got fixed. A user can proceed to override
       mergefile/triagefile parameters from the post execution analysis
       user definable procedures.
     * dvt87784 - (results) The cover directive coverage number reported
       within some summary reports has been fixed. This number is
       'coverage by instance'. In some cases is was being reported as the
       sum of 'coverage by instance' and 'coverage by DU'.
     * dvt89419 - Fixed bug where data from deferred UCDB load wasn't
       updating columns in VRM Results window.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.4f
     * dvt89504 - Supported the connection of array of interface instance
       passed as a port to instance array. Example:- intf i
       [p1:0][p2:0](); // interface array bot b[p1:0](i); // This will
       connect each b[j] to i[j]
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.4f
     * dvt89140 - (results) '-testhitdata' in the coverage html report
       (vcover/coverage report -html -details) will only report the first
       10 tests that hit the bin when the hit count hyperlink in clicked.
       Furthermore, it now accepts an integer value (ex: '-testhitdata= <i
       >'). When this integer i is specified, it will report up to the ith
       tests that hit the bin. Furthermore, the new switch
       '-testhitdataAll' is added. When used, all the tests that hit the
       bin will be reported.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.4f
     * dvt86459 - VRM testlist format now does not require a repeat count
       for each entry. A missing repeat count would indicate that there is
       only one entry for that test.
     * dvt86458 - A test expanded via VRM testlist format would
       automatically populate the testname parameter. Making it compatible
       with VRM test-centric mode. The automatically populated testname
       parameter will be used when the parameter is not defined elsewhere
       in the RMDB; as a default value.
     * [nodvtid] - The vrun -junit command line switch added in version
       10.5 is being removed with immediate effect. This switch was added
       for the initial Jenkins VRM integration but was found to be
       inefficient. The Questa VRM Jenkins plug-in will shortly be
       available on-line using the normal Jenkins plug-in delivery method.
       This supersedes the need for the -junit switch, for more
       information please contact customer support.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.4f
     * [nodvtid] - Added support for UPF command 'use_interface_cell'.
