<ul><li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

<p /><a name="compatibility"></a><font size="4"><b>Compatibility Issues with Release 2020.3</b></font>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-62783 - (source) Vlog and vopt handled cases where a class had the same name as a package incorrectly in some cases.  Given this example:&lt;code&gt;<br /><div>package P ;</div><div>    typedef logic type1_t;</div><div>    class P;</div><div>        typedef logic type2_t;</div><div>    endclass</div><div>endpackage</div><div>import P::*; // Import in $unit scope makes class named &quot;P&quot; potentially visible</div><div>module top;</div><div>    P::type1_t i; // This should be an error because &quot;P&quot; should reference the class</div><div>    P::type2_t j; // This should resolve to the type in class &quot;P&quot;</div><div>endmodule</div>&lt;/code&gt;<br />The correct behavior is to report an error for P::type1_t and accept P::type2_t, but previous releases reversed that behavior. </li>
 <li>QSIM-62590 - (source) In some cases, a randomize() call with in-line constraints, if the constraint symbol is not declared, it would insert dummy symbol instead, this now flags an error.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Mixed Language  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-57341 - (source, results)  The -printforces vsim command line option has been enhanced to print a transcript message, vsim-16110, for QFD flows, with the source, language, object name, time, and value for forces from all source: SystemVerilog, VHDL, SystemC, TCL (do file and VSIM prompt), VPI, FLI, UVM, and Signal Spy.<div><br /></div></li>
 <li>VISU-18493 - (source, results) With 2020.3 onwards Symphony analog Vector support has been added in visualizer debug support. This will break the forward compatibility ( 2020.3 generated design.bin cannot be loaded from 2020.2 visualizer) whereas backward compatibility will remain intact (2020.2 generated design.bin can be loaded from 2020.3 visualizer)<br /></li>

<p /><a name="verilogdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2020.3</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-63742 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause vsim to crash when evaluating a constraint containing an array.sum() expression involving a non-random dynamic array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63225 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would cause vsim to crash when evaluating constraints involving function calls. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63080 -  In some rare cases, randomize() call would cause vsim to crash when evaluating randsets with the BDD solver engine. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63716 - Significantly improved the performance of some complex randomize() calls involving array.sum() constraints. Some randomize() scenarios that would previously timeout are now able to be successfully solved.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63802 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause vsim to crash when evaluating constraints involving a non-random class field of the randomized class. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63738 - In some rare cases, randomize() would cause vsim to crash when evaluating complex constraints involving multiplication and cast expressions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-63610 - In some rare cases, a randomize() failure due to a constraint contradiction would generate a testcase (when -solvefailtestcase is enabled) that would not reproduce the contradiction. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64086 - In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly report a no-solution failure (constraint contradiction) when no actual contradiction exists. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62783 - (source) Vlog and vopt handled cases where a class had the same name as a package incorrectly in some cases.  Given this example:&lt;code&gt;<br /><div>package P ;</div><div>    typedef logic type1_t;</div><div>    class P;</div><div>        typedef logic type2_t;</div><div>    endclass</div><div>endpackage</div><div>import P::*; // Import in $unit scope makes class named &quot;P&quot; potentially visible</div><div>module top;</div><div>    P::type1_t i; // This should be an error because &quot;P&quot; should reference the class</div><div>    P::type2_t j; // This should resolve to the type in class &quot;P&quot;</div><div>endmodule</div>&lt;/code&gt;<br />The correct behavior is to report an error for P::type1_t and accept P::type2_t, but previous releases reversed that behavior. </li>
 <li>QSIM-62590 - (source) In some cases, a randomize() call with in-line constraints, if the constraint symbol is not declared, it would insert dummy symbol instead, this now flags an error.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64826 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would generate a solution violating a constraint involving an element of a virtual interface. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64538 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would crash when evaluating a randset with the BDD solve engine. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64417 -  In some rare cases, randomize() would generate a solution violating an in-line constraint involving a local automatic variable. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64644 - In some rare cases, randomize() would encounter an internal error when evaluating scenarios involving random variables of packed struct type. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64586 - In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly interpret a 'unique' constraint within an if/else or 'soft' context as a non-conditional, 'hard' constraint. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64319 - In some rare cases, randomize() would generate a solution violating a constraint of the form &quot;!(rand_var inside { const_array })&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64316 - In some rare cases, a randomize() call would crash when evaluating a constraint involving a non-random unpacked array. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64243 - In some rare cases, randomize() would trigger an internal error when evaluating a 'dist' constraint with values on the RHS that are outside of the domain of the target (LHS) type. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64160 - In some rare cases, during compilation, a package containing a randomize() call will trigger a spurious (vlog-2944) &quot;Illegal randomize() function call in random constraint&quot; error. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>

<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 2020.3</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-63443 -  Fixed the flow which was not causing the update.</li>
 <li>QSIM-64261 -  Fixed the crash caused in the code.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62097 -  In certain cases of records used inside procedures the value reflected was incorrect. This has been fixed. </li>
 <li>QSIM-62848 - Aggregate association of array elements resulted in an error when choice elements were record members. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62889 -  Having protected type variable definition inside subprogram caused an error during optimization. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56034 - In certain situations forcing a VHDL port signal from SystemVerilog resulted in a crash. This has been fixed. </li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="mixeddefects"></a><font size="4"><b>Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 2020.3</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-64244 -  When Verilog instantiates a VHDL design unit, processing for connectivity analysis under the -rnm vopt switch did not correctly handle ports associated by-name.</li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="vmdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>Verification Management Defects Repaired in 2020.3</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-64409 - Fixed problem in VRM where tests whose UCDBs get merged prior to the merging of the testplan would never report a testplan coverage value to the GUI or to any reports. Also fixed a benign side-effect where the merging of the testplan could, under some circumstances, get postponed to the end of the regression run.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="systemverilogenhancement"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Enhancements in 2020.3</b></font>
<ul><li>QSIM-63337 - Improved the readability of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report generated by randomize() calls with no solutions. Constraints of the form &quot;my_var inside { random_array }&quot; are now printed as-is, instead of being printed as the expansion of the elements of &quot;random_array&quot;.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-63338 - Improved the readability of the -solvefaildebug constraint contradiction report generated by randomize() calls with no solutions. Constraints involving constant variables now display the name of the constant variable (where possible) instead of an obfuscated name (such as &quot;#var#id&quot;) for -solvefaildebug=1 (previously, constant variable names were only preserved with -solvefaildebug=2).<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-63339 - Implemented a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;-svrandext=purecheck&quot;. When the &quot;purecheck&quot; extension is enabled, calls to class::randomize(null) will not invoke pre_randomize() and post_randomize() functions associated with the class on which randomize() is invoked. This extension is disabled by default.</li>
 <li>QSIM-62843 - Implemented a new SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;-svrandext=prerandfirst&quot;. When the &quot;prerandfirst&quot; extension is enabled, the pre_randomize() functions of rand dynamic array/queues of class handles will be executed prior to registering the constraints of the containing (parent) class (normal behavior is from the constraints of the parent class to be registered first). This extension is disabled by default.</li>
</ul>
