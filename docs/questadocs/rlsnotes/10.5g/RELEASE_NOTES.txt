   Key Information
     * (source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in
       10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be
       incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage.
       The required setup change is one of the followings:
       1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype
       declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
       OR
       2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to
       manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines.
       DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
       The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the
       above will incur the following warning at elab time
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.

       and the fatal error at runtime:
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'

     * The 10.5g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.5
       series.

   Release Announcements in 10.5g
     * Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
          + 10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual
            Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the
            executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be
            linked in with "msvcr120.dll". If you have SystemC or
            PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any
            gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be
            re-compiled with 10.5. Windows platform compiler details is as
            follows:
               o "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
               o "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with
                 "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for
                 download on a request basis.
                 Compiler versions have not been changed compared to
                 previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more
                 details.
               o (source) In the next major release (10.6)
                    # support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change
                      for Windows 8.1
                    # support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and
                      gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
               o Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser
                 PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML
                 documentation are fully functional.
                 Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may
                 result in no action, or it may load the title page of the
                 current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the
                 PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all
                 web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of
                 this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals
                 is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its
                 page-oriented layout.
                 Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate
                 between topics, and click links to examples, videos,
                 reference material, and other related technical content.
                 For information about Adobe's discontinued support of
                 Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available
                 options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on
                 SupportNet.
                 Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the
                 U.S. and other countries.
               o In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat
                 Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise
                 Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.
               o We regularly review our OS/Platform support for
                 Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification
                 products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
                 That process normally takes a number of years from
                 decision to action. Customer notifications are typically
                 only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and
                 Install Guide.
                 We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year
                 from now. We began notifications of this change back in
                 January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
                 As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are
                 discontinued, replacement hardware can only support
                 Windows 10. So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP
                 & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity and ability to
                 support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
                 Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to
                 discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only
                 Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10. However
                 we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6
                 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL
                 - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
                 Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

       Compatibility Issues with Release 10.5g
       Key Information Compatibility

en calling 'foo'

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-23582 - (results) In some rare cases, two calls to randomize()
       for the same class type and randstate would generate different
       results. This issue has been fixed.
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) In some cases simulation result differ
       between optimized and unoptimized cells with optimize cells
       selecting the wrong path delay when negative timing checks are
       present.
     * QSIM-17634 - (results) Optimized cell path delays could be
       incorrectly shortened when used with negative timing checks.
     * QSIM-8147 - (results) Restart with designs having negative timing
       check limits could effect simulation timing checks and functional
       evaluation behavior.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source) In the next major release (10.6)
          + support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows
            8.1
          + support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be
            dropped
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.5g
     * QSIM-14999 - Errors occur in -batch mode after queuing for a
       license and then resuming. This issue has been resolved.
     * QSIM-8201 - The simulation timescale is incorrect in some
       circumstances when running in -batch mode.
     * QSIM-24925 - Input-to-Input SDF INTERCONNECT delays are not
       annotated in optimized vsim run when there is not any driver on the
       high connection net.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.5g
     * QSIM-4843 - When the showbase radix flag is set, the analog
       waveform display defaulted to a signed radix instead of the
       specified radix, causing an incorrect waveform display. This issue
       has been resolved.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.5g
     * QSIM-26474 - In certain specific cases usage of slice expressions
       inside loop statements used to result in a crash. This has been
       fixed.
