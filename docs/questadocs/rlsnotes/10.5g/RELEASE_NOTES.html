<ul><li>(source) A bug related to Windows DLL symbol export is fixed in 10.5 and later. A side effect of the fix is that there may be incompatibility on Windows platforms regarding existing DPI usage. The required setup change is one of the followings:
<br>
1) Use vlog -dpiheader to generate DPI routine prototype declarations. Include generated DPI header file in the DPI code.
<br>
OR
<br>
2) If DPI header is not being generated or used, one needs to manually attach DPI_DLLESPEC in front of all DPI routines. DPI_DLLESPEC is a standard macro defined inside svdpi.h
<br>
The generated DPI header flow is recommended. Failing to do the above will incur the following warning at elab time
<br>
<pre>
# ** Warning: (vsim-3770) Failed to find user specified function 'foo' in DPI
C/C++ source files.
</pre>
and the fatal error at runtime:
<pre>
# ** Fatal: (vsim-160) test.sv(11): Null foreign function pointer encountered wh
en calling 'foo'
</pre>
</li>
 <li>The 10.5g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.5 series.</li>

<ul><li><p>
Release 10.5 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
<li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
<li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
<li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li>
 <li><p>
10.5 release onwards, Questa will be using Microsoft Visual Studio 12 a.k.a Visual Studio 13. This would mean that all the executables shipped with the 10.5 release and onwards would be linked in with "msvcr120.dll".
If you have SystemC or PLI/VPI/DPI/FLI libraries compiled with older release with any gcc compiler shipped with the product, those will have to be re-compiled with 10.5. 
Windows platform compiler details is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
<li> "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.2.1-mingw32vc12" and is shipped with the product. 
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw64vc12" and is shipped with the product.
<li> "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc9" has been replaced with "gcc-4.5.0-mingw32vc12" and will be available for download on a request basis.
<p>
Compiler versions have not been changed compared to previous release. Please refer to User's Manual for more details.
</li>
 <li>(source) In the next major release (10.6)<br>
   <ul> 
   <li>support for Windows 8.0 will be dropped. No change for Windows 8.1
   <li>support for gcc-4.3.3-linux and gcc-4.3.3-linux_x86_64 will be dropped
</ul></li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>
For information about Adobe's discontinued support of Adobe Reader on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge Article MG596568 on SupportNet.<br><br>
Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and other countries.</li>
 <li>In the next major release (10.6), support for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.</li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.
