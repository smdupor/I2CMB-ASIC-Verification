<ul><li> The 10.6g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.6 series. </li>
</ul>
<p /><h4><hr width="100%" /></h4>
<p /><a name="rlsannouncement"></a><font size="4"><b>Release Announcements in 10.6g</b></font>
<ul><li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64 and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64 GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.</li>
 <li>Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.</li>
 <li><p>
There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client.

</p><p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

</p><p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This 
release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.13_5.4 
and PCLS v9.13.5.2

</p><p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
</p><ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
</li><li>MSL v2015_1_patch2
</li><li>MGLS v9.13_5.4
</li><li>PCLS v9.13.5.2</li></ul></li>
 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br /><br />
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br /><br />
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br /><br />

 <li>(source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be deprecated in the next major 
release 10.7 following normal deprecation process:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
suppressible error message.
</li><li>In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not be 
accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error message.
</li><li>Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed. 
This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior) which 
is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.</li></ul></li>
 <li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
</p><p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
</p><p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP &amp; Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 in the future.
</p><p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 &amp; 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 &amp; 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

<ul><li>QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode parameters in the above cases.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58539 - (results)  The attributes <b>INSTANCE_NAME</b> and<b> PATH_NAME</b>, were not considered globally static.  If the prefix of the attribute is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or concurrent statement.  This currently results in extra statement executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different from previous versions. </li>

<ul><li>QSIM-56318 -  In some rare cases, an internal error would occur during randomize() indicating an error in slvACTNodeMap. This issue has been fixed.</li>

<ul><li>QSIM-56373 - A VHDL design unit whose source text is in 2 or more files is not supported.  An error will be issued if such a situation is detected.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode parameters in the above cases.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57546 -  If a package contains a package instance within a USE clause, static array constraints within the package instance may not be compiled correctly, possible causing a fatal internal error during elaboration of  the design by the simulator.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57795 - The compiler could report a fatal internal error if it encountered a generic declaration list with an index constraint within a generic vector preceding an interface package.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58539 - (results)  The attributes <b>INSTANCE_NAME</b> and<b> PATH_NAME</b>, were not considered globally static.
