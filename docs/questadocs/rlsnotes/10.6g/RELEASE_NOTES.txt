   Key Information
     * The 10.6g Update Release will be the last release in the 10.6
       series.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Release Announcements in 10.6g
     * Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Linux RHEL 5 x86/x86-64
       and SLES 10 x86/x86_64 have discontinued.
     * Beginning with 10.6 release, gcc-4.3.3-linux/gcc4.3.3-linux_x86_64
       GCC Compilers for SystemC have been discontinued.
     * Beginning with 10.6 release, support for Windows 8 series is
       limited to 8.1. Windows 8.0 has discontinued.
     * There is no licensing change between 10.5 and 10.6. However, if you
       are migrating to 10.6 from a release like 10.4 and older, please
       note that release 10.6 uses FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2
       client.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.13.0.2. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.13.0.2 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2015_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.13_5.4 and PCLS v9.13.5.2
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.13.1.2 server, v11.13.0.2 client
          + MSL v2015_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.13_5.4
          + PCLS v9.13.5.2
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

     * (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will be
       deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.
     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.6g

   VHDL Compatibility
     * QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of
       uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated
       with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT
       mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual
       variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left
       unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is
       now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode
       parameters in the above cases.
     * QSIM-58539 - (results) The attributes INSTANCE_NAME and PATH_NAME,
       were not considered globally static. If the prefix of the attribute
       is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an
       on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a
       change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or
       concurrent statement. This currently results in extra statement
       executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so
       the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that
       prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different
       from previous versions.

   Release Announcements Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (source, results) The -novopt command line switch will
       be deprecated in the next major release 10.7 following normal
       deprecation process:
          + The -novopt switch will be accepted in 10.7 with a deprecation
            suppressible error message.
          + In 10.8 or a subsequent release, the -novopt switch will not
            be accepted by the tool and cause tool to exit with error
            message.
          + Customer scripts using this switch will have to be changed.
            This legacy switch forces incremental mode (pre-6.0 behavior)
            which is sub-optimal, and it is no longer maintained.

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.6g
     * QSIM-56318 - In some rare cases, an internal error would occur
       during randomize() indicating an error in slvACTNodeMap. This issue
       has been fixed.
     * QSIM-56429 - In some rare cases, certain kinds of ternary
       constraint expressions would trigger an internal error during
       randomize(). This issue has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.6g
     * QSIM-56373 - A VHDL design unit whose source text is in 2 or more
       files is not supported. An error will be issued if such a situation
       is detected.
     * QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of
       uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated
       with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT
       mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual
       variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left
       unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is
       now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode
       parameters in the above cases.
     * QSIM-57546 - If a package contains a package instance within a USE
       clause, static array constraints within the package instance may
       not be compiled correctly, possible causing a fatal internal error
       during elaboration of the design by the simulator.
     * QSIM-57795 - The compiler could report a fatal internal error if it
       encountered a generic declaration list with an index constraint
       within a generic vector preceding an interface package.
     * QSIM-58539 - (results) The attributes INSTANCE_NAME and PATH_NAME,
       were not considered globally static. If the prefix of the attribute
       is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an
       on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a
       change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or
       concurrent statement. This currently results in extra statement
       executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so
       the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that
       prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different
       from previous versions.
