   Release Announcements in 10.3f
     * [nodvtid] -
       Platform support plans in future major releases.
       Starting 10.4, support for Windows XP and Windows Vista will be
       discontinued.
       Starting 10.6, support for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and
       Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 will be dropped.
       [10.3e] Licensing Information
       There is no licensing change between release 10.3 and 10.3e.
       However if you are migrating to 10.3e from a release like 10.2 and
       older, please note the following:
          + Starting 10.3, it uses FLEXnet v11.11.1.1. The vendor daemons
            and lmgrd that are shipped with this release will be FLEXnet
            version 11.11.1.1.
          + For floating licenses it will be necessary to verify that the
            vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e.,
            lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than
            11.11.1.1. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor
            daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.11.1.1 then it will be
            necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the
            vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.
          + If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything.
       [10.3b] OVL is upgraded to v2.8.1.
       [10.3b] The VHDL OSVVM (Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology)
       library, sources and documentation have been updated to version
       2014.01. Dependency checks in vopt and vsim will force
       recompilation of designs that use the osvvm library. If
       optimization is performed using vopt, the optimizer will
       automatically generate new optimized design units. Without the
       optimization step, vsim will detect dependency errors.
       [10.3] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4.0 has been
       discontinued.
       [10.2] Support for Solaris SPARC and Solaris x86 has been
       discontinued. All Solaris OS platforms are not supported.
       [10.2] Support for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3.0 and Novell
       SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) 9 has been discontinued.
       [10.1] Support for GCC versions
       gcc-4.1.2-sunos510/gcc-4.1.2-sunos510x86 has been discontinued.
       [10.0] Support for Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 has been discontinued.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.3f

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt80536 - (source) It is not permitted to change the protected
       status of an existing design unit by recompiling it, it must be
       deleted from the library and then recompiled.
     * dvt74219 - (results) Calling a builtin queue or associative array
       method on an out-of-bounds array element could result in a
       non-useful error. We now print a warning, and ignore the operation.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Command line force did not support string
       types. This is now fixed.
     * dvt77400 - (results) In some cases a bogus vsim-3391 'Requested
       memory exceeds physical memory' message can be generated when
       relatively little virtual memory is actually being used but very
       large objects are being allocated and freed while processing
       dynamic arrays and similar objects. In 10.3d and 10.3e it will
       generate a Failure messages that stops the simulation. It can be
       resumed with a second run command, or the 'suppress 3391' vsim
       switch can eliminate it. In 10.4 it is will not stop the
       simulation. It can be suppressed the same way. If the operating
       system shows that the process is indeed larger then physical
       memory, then the message is not bogus, and suggests that poor
       performance will result due to heavy paging. After the fix the
       transcript file will no longer contain the bogus message.
     * dvt77905 - (results) vopt didn't properly handle wildcard ports
       (".*") in bind instances when -pduspec or -tbxhierrefs was
       specified.
     * dvt79543 - (results) Fixed an issue that would cause randomize() to
       return 0 for some non-contradictory scenarios involving a single
       4-state random variable and a single 'dist' constraint.
     * dvt79679 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would generate
       differing results for a fully optimized simulation vs. a simulation
       where +acc is enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt73180 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() will produce
       spurious results for random variables involved in a !inside
       (not-inside) constraint if the LHS and RHS contain random
       variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt75654 - (results) SDF back-annotation now works with anonymous
       Non-ansi type source and destination ports.
     * dvt87351 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail
       with a spurious constraint contradiction related to an interaction
       between constraints involving array.size expressions and if-else
       constraints having a logical-and implicant/alternate constraint.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt87755 - (results) Stop giving warning vsim-SDF-8745 for valid
       retain Values. Support enhanced to take care of null values.
     * dvt68123 - (results) Improved handling of randomize() timeouts.
       Specify solver timeout threshold (in seconds) using any of the
       following methods: - vsim command line option: "-solvetimeout " -
       modelsim.ini [vsim] variable: "SolveTimeout=" - Verilog attribute:
       "solvetimeout=" A randomize() call will fail if the CPU time
       required to evaluate any randset exceeds the specified timeout. The
       default value is 500. A value of 0 will disable timeout failures.
     * dvt76429 - (results) Add support for const cast expression in
       constraints. The constraint expression "const'(expr)" will evaluate
       "expr" as a constant value. Random variables referenced by "expr"
       will be evaluated as if non-random. The value of a random variable
       referenced by "expr" will be sampled prior to randomize() (for
       class::randomize, the value will be sampled after pre_randomize()).
     * dvt71352 - (results) Support of pulse Error/Reject behavior on
       INTERCONNECT delays on optimized cell inputs. Earlier error 12031
       was reported for such cases.

   VHDL Compatibility
     * dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where
       both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give
       an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of
       association element". This has been fixed.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt68442 - (results) SV covergroup coverage was different in merged
       file depending on the merge order of input UCDB files due to
       excluded auto cross bins.
     * dvt74268 - (results) Covered auto cross bin was not getting into
       the merged UCDB if that bin is uncovered in the master UCDB.
     * dvt69525 - (results) Some toggle nodes of a VHDL record were
       missing in viewcov mode
     * dvt78215 - (results) Nested protected blocks causing unexpected
       coverage disable on some of the modules in the concerned hierarchy.
     * dvt78216 - (results) Protected module causing coverage disable of
       other modules in presence of -mfcu.

   Power Aware Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fixed an issue of wrong simulation result due
       to retention being applied on a signal in bitwise manner.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There was some noise in -pa_checks=t
       (QPA_PD_OFF_ACT) during power domain transitioning. This issue has
       been fixed now.
     * dvt79862 - (results) Fixed an issue in master-slave(also known as
       slave-alive) retention configuration. Now when the retention
       condition is active then the effect of clock, set or reset is
       ignored and the retained value is present at the register output.

   Verification Management Compatibility
     * dvt75521 - (results) Fixed a defect that caused statement coverage
       to be skipped when statement coverage was explicitly selected along
       with other coverage types. This effect many of the "coverage ..."
       command supporting the "-code ..." argument. EXAMPLE ARGUMENT:
       "-code st".
     * dvt76258 - (results) The ranktest summary has been augmented to
       include the number of contributing and non-contributing tests.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt76763 - Fixed a bug in pduspec flow which resulted in incomplete
       visibility requirements during the usage of partial hierarchical
       paths instead of complete path.
     * dvt78556 - When the path to the tmp directory (e.g. /tmp on linux)
       is redirected to a path that contains spaces, various errors can
       occur that are not obviously related to the tmp directory. The tmp
       directory is more commonly redirected on the Windows platform.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt63651 - A drag-area zoom-in operation in the wave window would
       sometimes zoom to the wrong location. This issue has been resolved.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed a bug where selected signals were missing from
       Visualizer dump when all signals are dumped
     * dvt77471 - Wave window cursor frequency display shows incorrectly
       scaled values for certain time resolution values. This problem has
       been corrected.
     * dvt67302 - The "edit" command and other uses of the
       PrefMain(Editor) setting failed to correctly invoke the user
       specified editor application whenever the application pathname
       contains spaces.
     * dvt78368 - Use of -g command-line option reports a GUI startup
       error. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt69368 - If a process is labeled with the same name as it's
       inclosing architecture, a breakpoint within the process will not
       display the location correctly when the simulation stops. This
       issue has been resolved.
     * dvt34881 - The list of recent Directories and recent Projects under
       the File menu can now be adjusted to list as many locations as the
       user wants. Two new preference settings have been added:
       PrefMain(recentDirectoryLimit) and PrefMain(recentProjectLimit).
       The default is no 8 entries for each list. The pull down menu
       entries will also display the full path when hovering over the
       particular item. This will make identifying long path names easier.
     * dvt68664 - Export Image for the Wave window would hang the user
       interface and the desktop. This issue has been resolved.
     * dvt67339 - Protected design units would not be displayed in the
       Library window of the GUI, even though they are listed when using
       the "vdir" command.
     * dvt86473 - Objects window will mis-sort items when the Active time
       is inactive.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt74219 - (results) Calling a builtin queue or associative array
       method on an out-of-bounds array element could result in a
       non-useful error. We now print a warning, and ignore the operation.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Command line force did not support string
       types. This is now fixed.
     * dvt75136 - Fixed a bug where sometimes zero delay output of a
       clocking block was not getting assigned to the outside variable if
       it changed after RENBA region.
     * dvt68524 - Fixed a bug where vopt/vlog are crashing due to a
       function call inside unelaborated generate. This was happening in
       few cases when the used function is defined after generate.
     * dvt75574 - Fix a crash in vsim when a literal 0 is passed to the
       port in a module instantiation that is expecting an interface.
     * dvt75146 - Fix a virtual interface related error in vsim when a
       modport is passed in a function.
     * dvt75604 - Fix a vlog crash while using bitwise XOR on an array
       whose bit select is $urandom_range(). Example:-
       check[$urandom_range(3,0)][$urandom_range(9,0)]^=1'b1; where check
       is defined as "bit [9:0] check [3:0];"
     * dvt75258 - Fixed a vopt crash when bind statement is used inside an
       generate which is further inside an interface.
     * dvt75568 - Fixed a bug where clocking block with clocking event
       with iff condition was causing a crash sometimes.
     * dvt75044 - A parametric interface referenced as a virtual interface
       could issue invalid errors in vopt for generate scopes that were
       not live.
     * dvt76118 - A typedef for a queue in a base class wasn't being
       properly handled in the child class.
     * dvt75895 - Vopt used to report following internal error for few of
       the cases involving parameters and parameterized types. This is now
       fixed. ** Error: test.sv(1): Questa has encountered an unexpected
       internal error: ../../src/vlog/vtree_dt2.c(1645). Please contact
       Questa support at http://supportnet.mentor.com/
     * dvt76214 - Fixed an issue where non-blocking assignments to the
       inputs of clocking blocks were not getting flagged in some cases,
       resulting in occasional crash of the tool. Now, an error message is
       generated for such a case. The error number is 8440.
     * dvt75845 - Variable part select on a class member dynamic array
       would sometimes give incorrect results. This has been fixed.
     * dvt75792 - Fixed a vsim crash when reporting missing timescale
       warning for an interface.
     * dvt75528 - Allowed a virtual function to be overridden by a pure
       virtual function. Below example will work after the fix. Example:-
       class a; virtual task body(); $display("hi, i am in a"); endtask
       endclass virtual class b extends a; pure virtual task body();
       endclass
     * dvt76387 - The prototypes of DPI functions inside nested interface
       were not generated in dpiheader generation.
     * dvt76021 - Fixed the vsim results in novopt mode when out of bound
       array element is passed in port connection.
     * dvt76289 - Use of a nonblocking event trigger, ie, "-->event_var",
       resulted in a memory leak.
     * dvt76314 - Fixed a bug in $enable_signal_spy/$disable_signal_spy
       which resulted in error(vsim-3861) in cases where absolute path for
       the signals is not given with these system calls. For example
       following usage which used to give error will now work correctly:
module top_tb;
...
$init_signal_spy("top_tb/sig1", "top_tb/sig2", 1, 0);
$enable_signal_spy("top_tb/sig1", "top_tb/sig2", 1);
...
endmodule

     * dvt76400 - Fixed a bug which resulted in false error(vsim-3045)
       while calling a SV task/function with default values of arguments
       from verilog. For example following usage which used to give error
       will now work correctly:
test1.sv :
//this file compiled as SV source code
...
task setup_gpio(int a = 1);
...
endtask
...

test2.v :
//This file compiled a verilog source code
...
tb.setup_gpio();
...

     * dvt76285 - Added compile time error which makes sure the name does
       not already exist in the scope with the same direction. Following
       usage is now compile time error :
 clocking clk_blk @(CLK);
        default input #0;
        input port1;
        input port1;
  endclocking : clk_blk;

     * [nodvtid] - A net having multiple drivers with varying strengths
       resolved to an incorrect value in some cases.
     * dvt76661 - The compiler incorrectly issued a "data size overflow"
       error for large unpacked arrays and structures that overflowed a
       32-bit integer size even when compiled for 64-bit.
     * dvt76962 - Fixed a vlog error when more than 32 bit constant value
       is passed to function $clog2().
     * dvt76247 - Fixed a vsim error when default type parameter (T)
       passed to a class (A) is of another class type (B) whose parameter
       is a virtual interface (x). For example class A#(type T =
       B#(virtual interface x));
     * dvt77400 - (results) In some cases a bogus vsim-3391 'Requested
       memory exceeds physical memory' message can be generated when
       relatively little virtual memory is actually being used but very
       large objects are being allocated and freed while processing
       dynamic arrays and similar objects. In 10.3d and 10.3e it will
       generate a Failure messages that stops the simulation. It can be
       resumed with a second run command, or the 'suppress 3391' vsim
       switch can eliminate it. In 10.4 it is will not stop the
       simulation. It can be suppressed the same way. If the operating
       system shows that the process is indeed larger then physical
       memory, then the message is not bogus, and suggests that poor
       performance will result due to heavy paging. After the fix the
       transcript file will no longer contain the bogus message.
     * dvt77310 - Type-casting $cast function with void will not result in
       error even when casting operation fails. For example following will
       not result in error when $cast fails :
void'($cast(d_obj, c_obj));
     * dvt77198 - Fixed a bug in case within statement which resulted in
       wrong simulation results while having more than 32 cases.
     * dvt70538 - Typedef defined in super class would sometimes not
       visible to derived class. This has been fixed.
     * dvt77431 - Fixed a vsim error when return type of an external
       function in parameterized class is the self referential class.
       Example:- function my_class#(my_class::PARAM1) my_class::get ();
     * dvt75438 - Fixed a vlog crash when new() is called on a forward
       typedef class.
     * dvt77608 - cosim libvsim.so exported symbol changed to avoid
       collision.
     * dvt77618 - Under some circumstances, use of 'bind' with an
       interface when using +floatparameters could result in a crash on a
       statement using a virtual interface that points to the bind target.
     * dvt77905 - (results) vopt didn't properly handle wildcard ports
       (".*") in bind instances when -pduspec or -tbxhierrefs was
       specified.
     * dvt78506 - When instantiating a Verilog module from VHDL, passing
       an empty string to a parameter could result in memory corruption.
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases redefined macros were not overwriting
       previous macro definitions.
     * dvt77832 - vencrypt would generate syntax errors when the last
       token in a file was a name from a `(tick) name.
     * dvt78513 - Fixed a bug in parsing of modport expression.
     * dvt78508 - Change a Time value error into a new warning if time
       value can not be stored in 32 bits. Rightmost digits greater than
       32 bit number will be truncated. For example 52111111561111ns will
       be truncated to 52111111500000ns.
     * dvt78334 - Fixed a bug when we have multiple packages with same
       name in different libraries.
     * dvt78035 - Fixed a vopt crash in a scenario when interface
       parameter is initialized through hier-ref and hier-ref is a
       structure field. Example :- interface isi_bus_if
       #(isi_bus_pkg::bus_param_t BUS_PARAM =
       isi_bus_pkg::bus_param_defaults) (); localparam ADDR_WIDTH =
       BUS_PARAM.ADDR_WIDTH; endinterface
     * dvt77732 - Fixed a vsim package import export error when some files
       are compiled with -timescale option with vlog and other files are
       not compiled with -timescale. This has been fixed now.
     * dvt77232 - Fixed a bug for bind instances, which resulted in
       simulation getting hanged.
     * dvt79110 - Fixed a vsim error when an array with more than 32 bit
       length is used.
     * dvt79011 - Fixed a memory corruption when the index of an
       associative array is of type bit.
     * dvt79782 - A select of a hierarchical reference to a net within a
       concatenation connected to an input port resulted in an elaboration
       crash in some cases.
     * dvt79924 - A cell module containing specify timing and system
       function calls resulted in a vopt crash in some unusual cases.
     * dvt79543 - (results) Fixed an issue that would cause randomize() to
       return 0 for some non-contradictory scenarios involving a single
       4-state random variable and a single 'dist' constraint.
     * dvt79679 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would generate
       differing results for a fully optimized simulation vs. a simulation
       where +acc is enabled. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt73180 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() will produce
       spurious results for random variables involved in a !inside
       (not-inside) constraint if the LHS and RHS contain random
       variables. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt80393 - Specifying multiple comma-delimited extensions via the
       "vsim -svext" switch would result in an error. This issue has been
       fixed.
     * dvt81103 - Fixed a small memory leak related to resizing a 'rand'
       or 'randc' dynamic array during randomize().
     * dvt80536 - (source) It is not permitted to change the protected
       status of an existing design unit by recompiling it, it must be
       deleted from the library and then recompiled.
     * dvt75654 - (results) SDF back-annotation now works with anonymous
       Non-ansi type source and destination ports.
     * dvt87351 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail
       with a spurious constraint contradiction related to an interaction
       between constraints involving array.size expressions and if-else
       constraints having a logical-and implicant/alternate constraint.
       This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt87755 - (results) Stop giving warning vsim-SDF-8745 for valid
       retain Values. Support enhanced to take care of null values.

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt75836 - Compilation of VHDL source code would generate temporary
       data in a flat library causing it to grow without bound. The
       temporary data is now cleaned up at the end of every compile.
     * dvt71451 - Predefined attribute A'ELEMENT could not have as its
       prefix a function call. The LRM is not clear on this since A must
       be either an array type name or appropriate for an array object,
       and a function call is neither. But because other attributes like
       A'RANGE where A is a function call are handled as legal, the
       A'ELEMENT attribute now also allows this. Further, as a
       non-compliant extension of the language O'SUBTYPE may also have O
       be a function call.
     * dvt74123 - In a subprogram appearing in a protected type body,
       another subprogram call with a named association element for a
       formal having the same name as a data member of the protected type
       would cause a compiler error. This is now fixed.
     * dvt73707 - Individual association involving a multidimensional
       array type formal whose index subtypes are enumeration types would
       not compile. This has been fixed.
     * dvt74843 - The compiler would hang if it encountered a VHDL error
       involving a type declaration of an array type whose element subtype
       is an incomplete type of the same name as the array type itself.
     * dvt70676 - Some uses of A'RANGE (and A'REVERSE_RANGE) where a value
       (not a range) is required were not being caught as errors by the
       compiler.
     * dvt69385 - Declaring and using aliases of external signals in a
       block would crash.
     * dvt73631 - If a subprogram instantiates a package, and then calls a
       subprogram of the package, variables of the called subprogram may
       not be visible or accessible in the graphical interface or through
       the examine command. In addition, if the design is optimized with
       vopt using the +cover switch to enable code coverage, during
       elaboration of the design, the simulator's console terminal may
       report errors of the form:
../../src/vsim/rtu.c(xxxx). Please contact Questa support at http://supportnet.m
entor.com/

     * dvt77077 - A crash could occur when using an output port as the
       actual to a subprogram formal that is a signal Rising_edge is an
       example of such a subprogram. Because of optimization, this doesn't
       no occur for all cases and maybe affected by the use of switches
       like -no1164 and -O1.
     * dvt76995 - A variable of a protected type that contains a data
       member that is of class FILE could not be displayed, examined, or
       logged properly. Since FILEs themselves cannot be logged, such a
       protected type variable will have the FILE data member be shown as
       "Not Loggable", and the WLF file (for post-sim viewing) will not
       show the variable as having this FILE at all.
     * dvt77275 - A Fatal error during elaboration could occur within an
       optimized vhdl process if signal valued attributes are used within
       that process. The name reported for the optimized processed will
       start #MERGED#.
     * dvt73987 - In Some particular cases, compilation time on windows
       had increased. This has been fixed.
     * dvt72396 - In Some specific cases, an optimization used to give
       incorrect results. This has been fixed.
     * dvt79119 - The "change" command would not work if attempted on an
       access object or member of such.
     * dvt77970 - For some specific cases of aggregate expression,
       evaluation of expressions use to give incorrect error. This has
       been fixed.
     * dvt80970 - If a instance of a generic package is made directly
       visible with a via a use statement. Multiple references to the
       package will result in the error
** Error: fails.vhd(4): (vcom-1078) Identifier "pkg" is not directly visible. Po
tentially visible declarations are:
work.pkg in library work (package)
work.pkg at pkg.vhd(1) (declaration)

     * dvt80408 - Having an entity whose name is 200 character long or
       longer could cause the following error during optimization.
** Fatal: (vopt-8) Problem while reading data file
"/export/home/designtree/work/top_opt/vopt4km4ma".
** Error: (vopt-2064) Compiler back-end code generation process terminated with
code 2.

     * dvt81528 - Occasionally vcom, vopt, or vlog, could crash
       unexpectedly because of the command line arguments. Slightly
       changing the argument number or order can work around the problem.
     * dvt81883 - An attempt to log an empty array of records, whose
       fields also contain arrays, by explicitly using the log command, or
       by adding the array to the list or wave windows, could cause the
       simulator to crash.
     * dvt82617 - Certain known errors deferred until simulation runtime
       (because whether or not they would be executed is not known) would
       cause a vopt error and fail to create an optimized design.
     * dvt82810 - A function containing a nested function called to
       initialize a subtype of an object declared in the outer function
       could cause the design to crash when loaded.
     * dvt81426 - If an array-valued signal has only constant-index signal
       assignments in a particular process, and the process contains an
       expression involving either the 'driving or 'driving_value
       attribute, incorrect code was generated for the attribute
       expression. As a result, the simulator could crash during
       evaluation of the expression.
     * dvt86918 - When an inner nested GENERATE block contained a slice
       name whose slice range depended in an outer FOR-GENERATE's loop
       parameter, and when a component instantiation in the inner GENERATE
       contained a GENERIC MAP association element that had an actual that
       depended on this slice name, then the compiler would create bad
       code that could crash the simulator.
     * dvt86813 - A CASE GENERATE statement that contained an external
       name in the expression or in a choice in an alternative would
       sometimes cause a simulator crash.
     * dvt88164 - (results) In some specific mixed language cases where
       both numeric_std and 1164 packages were included vcom used to give
       an incorrect error saying "Cannot resolve expression type of
       association element". This has been fixed.

   SystemC Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt75314 - scparse compilation error with conversion function
       templates whose destination type is a reference to a complete
       abstract class as been fixed.
     * dvt78678 - Fixed sccom leaving object files in the current working
       directory on a compile failure.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt76087 - Non-zero assertion attempt count was reported even when
       the design had $assertoff for the entire simulation.
     * dvt75755 - Fixed a bug where assertion control system tasks were
       causing compiler error if used in functions.
     * dvt77160 - Fixed a bug where using %c in severity system task
       ($error etc.) was causing the tool to crash.
     * dvt79482 - Fixed a bug where tool was giving internal error during
       compilation if the design contained a concurrent assertion inside
       an unnamed always block and the assertion had an action block with
       begin...end.
     * dvt80720 - Fixed a bug where nexttime property was not working
       correctly on the right side of implies property.
     * dvt82695 - An assertion having suffix implication with boolean RHS
       gave incorrect result in fully optimized simulation.
     * dvt84891 - Assertion having $past with clock gating fires
       incorrectly.
     * dvt85213 - Assertion with suffix implication having boolean LHS and
       RHS fired incorrectly after that assertion was disabled by
       $assertoff.
     * dvt85418 - Assertion fires incorrectly when using SVA 'not'
       operator over a sequence.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed bug in VRM History viewer resulting in SQL error
       when Action row is expanded.
     * [nodvtid] - The "View" menus which display test/merged coverage and
       Results Analysis now work correctly in the VRM History viewer.
     * dvt75521 - (results) Fixed a defect that caused statement coverage
       to be skipped when statement coverage was explicitly selected along
       with other coverage types. This effect many of the "coverage ..."
       command supporting the "-code ..." argument. EXAMPLE ARGUMENT:
       "-code st".
     * [nodvtid] - Pro-active grid checks have been disabled.
     * [nodvtid] - In VRM, if a given Action is supposed to produce a
       UCDB, and does, but the UCDB is unreadable, the Action will be
       considered to have failed and the UCDB TESTSTATUS will be reported
       as "Unknown Error" in the VRM log.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed two bugs in VRM's handling of array jobs for UGE
       grids.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt74664 - The result of find_objects command is now dumped in a
       file specified with vopt option -pa_dbgfindobj=filename.txt
     * dvt75575 - Extended Power Aware static checks to analyze PST
       information for both power/ground pairs simultaneously when PST
       Composition is enabled. This is available with -pa_pstcompflags=pg
       option.
     * dvt76982 - With -pa_enable=verbosereporting option, the tool now
       prints the full hierarchical path of the power domain in
       report.pa.txt, report.upf.txt & report.mspa.txt.
     * dvt77535 - Fixed an issue where the design when run in PA mode the
       tool gives vopt error 12003 and 7033. Whereas in normal mode, these
       vopt errors did not occur. These errors are not present in PA mode
       now.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) Fixed an issue of wrong simulation result due
       to retention being applied on a signal in bitwise manner.
     * [nodvtid] - Fixed an issue of high disk usage due to excessive
       bind_checker commands applied on same scope.
     * [nodvtid] - In a specific case vopt PA was crashing due to
       CORRUPT_ON_ACTIVITY simstate. This issue has been fixed now.
     * [nodvtid] - In a specific case vopt was crashing due to UPF
       connect_supply_net command on hdl ports.This issue has been fixed
       now.
     * dvt78410 - During static analysis of power states and PSTs, the
       tool used to give pessimistic results when dont-cares are used in a
       case where a specific combination of supply values are assumed
       after expanding the dont-cares. This combination is not defined in
       other PSTs sharing the same supplies and hence should be ignored
       during expansion. This has been fixed.
     * dvt77969 - The vopt used to crash when a specific style of
       expression was used in add_power_state command. This expression
       results in a cyclic dependency of UPF objects referred in it. This
       has been fixed.
     * dvt79470 - Every PA dynamic check (assertion) will be limited to 15
       messages. Once this limit is reached, that particular dynamic
       message will be suppressed. This limit can be controlled by user
       using CLI " pa msg -suppressafter ".
     * [nodvtid] - (results) There was some noise in -pa_checks=t
       (QPA_PD_OFF_ACT) during power domain transitioning. This issue has
       been fixed now.
     * [nodvtid] - Vopt was throwing wrong error 2164 in case of nested
       modules. This issue has been fixed now.
     * dvt79862 - (results) Fixed an issue in master-slave(also known as
       slave-alive) retention configuration. Now when the retention
       condition is active then the effect of clock, set or reset is
       ignored and the retained value is present at the register output.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.3f
     * dvt65590 - The wlfman filter command could produce incorrect
       results when filtering Verilog nets that shared bits with other
       Verilog nets.
     * dvt75538 - Using the -wlftlim or -wlfslim switches to control the
       size of the WLF file could result in the wave and list displays not
       being updated correctly following a simulation run. The data in the
       WLF file was correct, but the windows would get confused by missed
       communications from the simulation kernel. The problem has been
       fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Enhancements in 10.3f
     * dvt77101 - vlog, qverilog, mc2com and vsim have a new option '-vv'
       to print the C/C++ compile/link subprocess command line
       information. Additionally, mc2com and vsim in the MC2 mode will
       print the MC2 subprocess command line information.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.3f
     * dvt68123 - (results) Improved handling of randomize() timeouts.
       Specify solver timeout threshold (in seconds) using any of the
       following methods: - vsim command line option: "-solvetimeout " -
       modelsim.ini [vsim] variable: "SolveTimeout=" - Verilog attribute:
       "solvetimeout=" A randomize() call will fail if the CPU time
       required to evaluate any randset exceeds the specified timeout. The
       default value is 500. A value of 0 will disable timeout failures.
     * dvt76429 - (results) Add support for const cast expression in
       constraints. The constraint expression "const'(expr)" will evaluate
       "expr" as a constant value. Random variables referenced by "expr"
       will be evaluated as if non-random. The value of a random variable
       referenced by "expr" will be sampled prior to randomize() (for
       class::randomize, the value will be sampled after pre_randomize()).
     * dvt76165 - Allowed integral to string type assignments without
       going through a explicit cast under "-permissive" or "-suppress
       7070" option. Following usage will work with "-permissive" or
       "-suppress 7070" :
function void register_c(string name);
endfunction

reg r;
register_c(r);

     * dvt71352 - (results) Support of pulse Error/Reject behavior on
       INTERCONNECT delays on optimized cell inputs. Earlier error 12031
       was reported for such cases.
     * dvt76748 - -gblso option has been enhanced to accept multiple
       shared objects.
       -gblso <shared_obj>[,<shared_obj>...]
       When multiple shared objects are specified, they will first be
       merged internally and then loaded as single shared object.
     * dvt77101 - Warnings generated during the C/C++ source file
       compilation will be echoed to stdout by default.
       Additionally, vlog and qverilog have a new option -ccwarn
       [on|off|verbose|strict].
       The -ccwarn option will control the GNU warning/error flags for the
       C/C++ files compilation.
       Options are:
       on (default): compiles with -Wreturn-type, -Wimplicit,
       -Wuninitialized, -Wmissing-declarations gcc options
       off: compiles without any warning options
       verbose: compiles with the -Wall gcc option
       strict: compiles with the -Werror gcc option
     * dvt83013 - The protected state of a design unit can now be changed
       by recompiling. In the past this seemed to work with Verilog but
       was intentionally not allowed with VHDL. Now, both languages allow
       this, and the implementation has been made more uniform and
       correct.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Enhancements in 10.3f
     * dvt74960 - The message indicating -64 or -32 has no effect has been
       made to only appear when the switch indeed has no effect, and it
       has been added to the cataloged message system. Furthermore, on
       Windows where the option is not available, a catalog message comes
       out indicating so.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemC Enhancements in 10.3f
     * dvt75791 - Existing vsim switch -undefsyms is extended to vopt.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.3f
     * dvt65076 -
Introducing CLI and prgama based exclusion for same state transitions.
To exclude same state transition of s1 and s2 i.e. s1->s1 and s2->s2
Pragma=> // coverage fsm_off -fsamestate cst s1 s2
CLI => coverage exclude -du top -fsamestate cst s1 s2
To exclude all same state transition:
Pragma=>  // coverage fsm_off -fsamestate cst
CLI => coverage exclude -du top -fsamestate cst
     * [nodvtid] - vcover parallelmerge command allows user to override
       temporary directory path.
     -tempdir "< dir_path >"        : Specify temporary directory for intermedia
te output
                                      (Default: "$cwd/TEMP_MERGE_DIR")


     * dvt78301 - vcover parallelmerge -ucdbname option is now replaced
       with -dbname option. New option will accept both UCDB and
       CoverStore test database files selection for the merge. Default
       -dbname value for UCDB and CoverStore is '*.ucdb' and '*'
       respectively.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.3f
     * dvt76258 - (results) The ranktest summary has been augmented to
       include the number of contributing and non-contributing tests.
     * [nodvtid] - Added a new "-noucdb" command-line option to vrun (VRM)
       to avoid unnecessary UCDB file reading.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Power Aware Enhancements in 10.3f
     * [nodvtid] - Added the vopt option '-pa_enable=alwaysonbuf' to turn
       off corruption of buf primitives.
     * dvt76437 - Support for UPF command "query_cell_instances" has been
       added.
     * dvt75000 - UPF package function supply_on/supply_off can now be
