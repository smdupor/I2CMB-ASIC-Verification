   Key Information
     * (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag
       below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.
     * This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license
       servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.
       For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the
       vendor daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd)
       have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the
       current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less
       than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license
       server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained
       in this release.
       If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This
       release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS
       v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0
       In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
          + FLEXnet v11.14.1.3
          + MSL v2017_1_patch2
          + MGLS v9.17_10.2.4
          + PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

       Release Announcements in 10.7a

     * We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and
       related functional verification products to add new platforms and
       discontinue old ones.
       That process normally takes a number of years from decision to
       action. Customer notifications are typically only one year in an
       advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
       We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.
       We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the
       10.5d and 10.6a releases
       As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued,
       replacement hardware can only support Windows 10. So say Microsoft
       and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo. That will limit our capacity
       and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
       Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue
       supporting Windows 7 & 8.1 Thus the only Windows version for 10.8
       will be for Windows 10. However we will continue to support Windows
       7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned
       EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with
       Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.

   Compatibility Issues with Release 10.7a

   Key Information Compatibility
     * [nodvtid] - (results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands
       will flag below error now.
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the
 -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switc
h to preserve visibility for
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Objec
t Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below
       error.
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used wit
h the optimized design.
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

       In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is
       recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's
       design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow
       completely.

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt103663 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function
       calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a
       $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant
       (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a
       fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result
       of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver
       during a randomize call.
     * dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed
       structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of
       a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
       The support has been added as default and will be an error with
       -pedanticerrors.

   General Compatibility
     * dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being
       printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of
       real types in VCD.

   Coverage Compatibility
     * dvt100810 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to
       cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose
       resulting output is still single bit.
       For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] &&
       in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as
       single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded
       as a single term for coverage.
       This feature was earlier enabled by the switch -coverFecSingleTerm.
       But 10.7 onwards, this feature will be enabled by default (works
       when FEC coverage is enabled). To disable the feature,
       -nocoverfecsingleterm switch (in addition to other coverage
       switches) is needed in vlog/vopt.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The UDP Coverage is not a recommended
       coverage collection metric and has been deprecated in 10.7. The
       following suppressible error message appears when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected in 10.7,
       "** Error (suppressible): (vlog-192) UDP expression coverage has
       been deprecated and will be removed in future releases."
       The user can still use UDP coverage feature by suppressing the
       error, however it will be removed completely in future releases.
     * dvt103953 - (results) If the bin iff condition is false at the end
       of a successful transition bin sequence matching then the counter
       is not incremented as before, but the matched result is no more
       preserved now to increment the bin later when the iff condition
       becomes true.
     * dvt105070 - (results) Assuming that LRM has a typo on missing open
       square bracket in bin syntax, allowing coverpoint name in binrhs
       without any with-expression
   _______________________________________________________________________

   General Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being
       printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of
       real types in VCD.
     * dvt104690 - An issue related to licensing is fixed. The issue
       caused a hang if the checked-out license feature is about to expire
       (default is 15 days before expiration). A workaround was to set the
       'MGLS_EXP_WARN_DAYS' variable to '1'. Now, the workaround is not
       needed. This issue was not applicable to Windows platform.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * dvt105987 - The "change" command failed to accept variable names
       with index or select expressions, only in -batch mode. This issues
       has bee resolved.
     * dvt103413 - The GUI crash reading a wlf file containing SV union
       nets has been resolved.
     * dvt107688 - In some cases, signals sent from the source window to
       other windows will not be from the correct scope. This issue has
       been resolved.
     * dvt108473 - From the Message Viewer, when opening the source file
       referenced in a message, if the file cannot be found, a dialog box
       will pop up, requesting the user to select the location of the
       file.
     * dvt106889 - "vmap" fails silently when there is a leftover lock
       file. Now it will report a warning 5 times, 5 seconds apart, before
       giving up and returning an error status.
     * dvt109082 - Repaired GUI crash when associative arrays are present
       in automatic functions.
     * dvt109387 - The Coverage HTML Report dialog box sometimes fails
       with an "# ** Error: (vsim-4003) Invalid option '-code '." message.
       This issue has been repaired.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * [nodvtid] - In some cases where a fork..join block contained a
       nested fork..join_any sub-block, disabling the outer block would
       not immediately disable the inner block.
     * [nodvtid] - Vopt would sometimes crash in designs with interfaces
       that imported complex types from packages.
     * dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints,
       -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report
       that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause
       of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would
       incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple
       'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the
       rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This
       issue has been fixed.
     * dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not
       evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious
       constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.
     * dvt103663 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function
       calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a
       $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant
       (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a
       fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result
       of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver
       during a randomize call.
     * dvt109061 - In some rare cases, randomize() would fail with the
       following spurious error message: "Invalid random variable in index
       expression for constraint" -- even in cases where an index
       expression only referred to constant (non-random) variables. This
       issue has been fixed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * dvt106202 - An internal error was report in some cases in vcom or
       vopt if an array signal is indexed or sliced. The index expression
       or slice expression contains a locally static expression that has a
       primary is a record or array. For example:
constant C : integer_vector(0 to 1) := ( 3, 6);
signal   S : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
....
   o <= S(C(0)); -- The use of C(0) can cause an internal error

     * dvt106288 - If a package contains a generic of the same name as a
       generic of an entity, and the package is instantiated within the
       entity, the compiler may incorrectly use the static value of the
       entity's generic rather than the package's generic when producing
       code for the package instantiation.
     * dvt104870 - A simulator crash could occur if an object was declared
       with an initial expression that was the name of another object
       whose initial value was a function call whose return type mark was
       the predefined attribute SUBTYPE with a prefix that was one of the
       function input parameters (when that parameter is of an
       unconstrained composite type).
     * dvt107650 - Reference to a package constant defined within a
       package instance that is itself defined within a simple package
       could cause the compiler to produce an internal error.
     * dvt108324 - The compiler could crash when encountering a composite
       assignment, where the left-hand side contains a variable whose type
       is an interface type.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SVA/PSL Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * dvt107868 - Fixed a bug where assertion severity system tasks were
       not getting overridden when -systfoverride switch was specified.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Verification Management Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * dvt105414 - Fixed an infinite-loop bug in the VRM HTML report
       generator's RMDB expansion algorithm which would occur when a
       usertcl procedure implementing a "foreach" parameter tried to
       expand another parameter.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   WLF and VCD logging Defects Repaired in 10.7a
     * dvt104923 - Incorrect time advance values in the WLF file caused
       signal transitions to be incorrect in some rare conditions. This
       bug generally manifested itself by signals transitions in the wave
       window showing correctly when zoomed in, but disappearing as one
       zoomed out, then possibly showing again upon zooming out even
       further. This has been fixed, but the bug is in the WLF writer and
       requires WLF files demonstrating this behavior to be regenerated.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   User Interface Enhancements in 10.7a
     * dvt106543 - Color preference settings have been added for the
       message indicators at the top of the Wave window. The new
       preference variables are PrefWave(messageNoteColor),
       PrefWave(messageWarnColor), and PrefWave(messageFailColor).
     * dvt109197 - Added PrefWave(LineWidth) preference define the width
       of waveform lines. The default is '1'. Defining larger widths are
       useful for high density monitors where a single pixel wide line is
       too narrow to see clearly.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   SystemVerilog Enhancements in 10.7a
     * dvt99791 - For C/C++ auto compile, modelsim.ini variable
       "DpiCppInstall" has been added which is the equivalent of the
       '-dpicppinstall' command line option.
     * dvt99791 -
The '-cppinstall' and '-cpppath' options will be honored for C/C++ auto compile
in the absence of '-dpicppinstall' and '-dpicpppath' options.
For SystemC compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path is
 the following:
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath
For C/C++ auto compile, the order of precedence in determining the compiler path
 is the following:
- -dpicppinstall
- -dpicpppath
- -cppinstall
- -cpppath

     * dvt101556 -
Warning numbers 7076 and 7077 for vlog and vsim  have been upgraded to suppressi
ble errors. They will now appear as:
** Error (suppressible): (<TOOL>-7076) The gcc/g++ path '<path specified>' via -
dpicppinstall swicth is not qualified and is ignored.
** Error (suppressible): (<TOOL>-7077) the path '<path specified>' via -dpicpppa
th switch not a valid gcc/g++ full path and is ignored.
vlog/vsim -suppress 7076 | 7077 to suppress the error.

     * dvt103053 - Add vlog/vopt -svinputport=compat option to default an
       input port declared with a type but without the "var" keyword to
       "wire", as required by the LRM, but only if the type is compatible
       with a net declaration. The fully LRM compliant option
       -svinputport=net will default to "wire" even if the type is not
       compatible with a net declaration ("bit", for example), potentially
       resulting in compilation errors. The default behavior remains
       unchanged, which is -svinputport=relaxed, where only a a type that
       is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single dimension vector type
       defaults to "wire".
     * dvt107371 - For implicit vopt (2-step) flow, detailed -stats output
       can now be obtained by passing required -stats=* option to
       -voptargs="" along with -vopt_verbose option in vsim.
     * dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed
       structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of
       a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
       The support has been added as default and will be an error with
       -pedanticerrors.

   Coverage Enhancements in 10.7a
     * dvt100810 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to
       cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose
       resulting output is still single bit.
       For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] &&
       in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as
       single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded
       as a single term for coverage.
       This feature was earlier enabled by the switch -coverFecSingleTerm.
       But 10.7 onwards, this feature will be enabled by default (works
       when FEC coverage is enabled). To disable the feature,
       -nocoverfecsingleterm switch (in addition to other coverage
       switches) is needed in vlog/vopt.
     * [nodvtid] - (results) The UDP Coverage is not a recommended
       coverage collection metric and has been deprecated in 10.7. The
       following suppressible error message appears when usage of UDP
       coverage is detected in 10.7,
       "** Error (suppressible): (vlog-192) UDP expression coverage has
       been deprecated and will be removed in future releases."
       The user can still use UDP coverage feature by suppressing the
       error, however it will be removed completely in future releases.
     * dvt103953 - (results) If the bin iff condition is false at the end
       of a successful transition bin sequence matching then the counter
       is not incremented as before, but the matched result is no more
       preserved now to increment the bin later when the iff condition
       becomes true.
     * dvt105070 - (results) Assuming that LRM has a typo on missing open
       square bracket in bin syntax, allowing coverpoint name in binrhs
       without any with-expression

   Verification Management Enhancements in 10.7a
     * dvt101783 - Added "-minmerge", "-mintriage", "-mergewait", and
       "-triagewait" command-line options to vrun for fine-grained control
       of queued auto-merge function.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   MC2 Enhancements in 10.7a
     * dvt108544 - Introducing wavedir command in vsim and visualizer for
       MC2 flow. The command creates a qwave dataset to be read in
       visualizer. The command syntax is vsim ... -qwavedb=+wavedir=
        ... vis ..... -wavedir
