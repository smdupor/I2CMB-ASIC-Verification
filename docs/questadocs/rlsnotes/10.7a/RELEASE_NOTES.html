<ul><li>(results) -novopt flow has been deprecated and commands will flag below error now.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vlog-12110) All optimizations are disabled because the -novopt option is in effect.
 This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. If you are using this switch to preserve visibility for 
 Debug or PLI features, please see the User's Manual section on Preserving Object Visibility with vopt. -novopt
 option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. 
</pre>

Using -novopt with optimized design in vsim will also flag below error.

<pre>
** Error (suppressible): (vsim-12110) -novopt option has no effect when used with the optimized design. 
-novopt option is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
</pre>

In 10.7 release, user can suppress this error. But, it is recommended to remove any dependency on -novopt flow from user's design environment. Future releases will remove -novopt flow completely.</li>
 <li><p>
This release uses new licensing version which needs to have license servers upgraded to FLEXnet v11.14.1.3.

<p>
For floating licenses, it will be necessary to verify that the vendor  daemon (i.e., mgcld) and the license server (i.e., lmgrd) have FLEXnet versions equal to or greater than 11.14.1.3. If the current FLEXnet version of your vendor daemon and lmgrd are less than 11.14.1.3 then it will be necessary to stop your license server and restart it using the vendor daemon and lmgrd contained in this release.

<p>
If you use node locked licenses you don't need to do anything. This release will update licensing to MSL v2017_1_patch2 with MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 and PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<p>
In summary, this release uses the following license versions:
<ul>
<li>FLEXnet v11.14.1.3 <li>MSL v2017_1_patch2 <li>MGLS v9.17_10.2.4 <li>PCLS v9.17.10.2.0

<p /><a name="rlsannouncement"></a><font size="4"><b>Release Announcements in 10.7a</b></font>
<ul><li>We regularly review our OS/Platform support for Questa/ModelSim and related functional verification products to add new platforms and discontinue old ones.
<p>
That process normally takes a number of years from decision to action.  Customer notifications are typically only one year in an advance through our Release Notes and Install Guide.
<p>
We plan to make a change in our Windows support, 1 year from now.  We began notifications of this change back in January 2017 with the 10.5d and 10.6a releases
<p>
As our existing Windows machines breakdown or are discontinued, replacement hardware can only support Windows 10.
So say Microsoft and our hardware vendors, HP & Lenovo.  That will limit our capacity and ability to support Windows 7 & 8.1 in the future.
<p>
Therefore, starting with 10.8 (FCS Dec 2018) we plan to discontinue supporting Windows 7 & 8.1
Thus the only Windows version for 10.8 will be for Windows 10.
However we will continue to support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.6 and 10.7 release series until their planned EOL (10.6 EOL - mid 2019, 10.7 EOL - mid 2020) to coincide with Microsoft's EOL for Windows 7.

 <li>Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation are fully functional.<br><br>
Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of its page-oriented layout.<br><br>
Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics, and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other related technical content.<br><br>

<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints, -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt105375 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would incorrectly consider a class instance as non-random if multiple 'rand' aliases to the same instance were encountered, and if the rand_mode of some of those aliases were 0 and some were 1. This issue has been fixed.
</li>
 <li>dvt105372 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would not evaluate 'default' constraints correctly, resulting in a spurious constraint contradiction failure. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>dvt103663 - (results) Improved support for $clog2 system function calls within the context of random constraints. In the past, a $clog2 function call in a constraint would be handled as a constant (non-random) value. The new behavior is for $clog2 to behave as a fully bidirectional constraint expression -- the operand and result of $clog2 will be solved simultaneously by the constraint solver during a randomize call.</li>
 <li>dvt106517 - (results) Added non-LRM support to allow a packed structure to be used for foreach indexing. So for an object "st" of a packed structure, writing "foreach(st[i])" is no longer an error.
The support has been added as default and will be an error with -pedanticerrors.  </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of real types in VCD. </li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>Coverage  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>dvt100810 - (results) The Expression Coverage has been enhanced to cover expressions that contain multi-bit sub-expressions but whose resulting output is still single bit.
<br>
For example, expressions like (in1==in2) and (in1[2:0] && in2[2:0]), which were not covered earlier, are now identified as single terminal expressions where the entire expression is regarded as a single term for coverage.
<br>
This feature was earlier enabled by the switch -coverFecSingleTerm. But 10.7 onwards, this feature will be enabled by default (works when FEC coverage is enabled). To disable the feature, -nocoverfecsingleterm switch (in addition to other coverage switches) is needed in vlog/vopt. 
<br></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (results) The UDP Coverage is not a recommended coverage collection metric and has been deprecated in 10.7. The following suppressible error message appears when usage of UDP coverage is detected in 10.7,
<br>
"** Error (suppressible): (vlog-192) UDP expression coverage has been deprecated and will be removed in future releases."
<br>
The user can still use UDP coverage feature by suppressing the error, however it will be removed completely in future releases.
</li>
 <li>dvt103953 - (results) If the bin iff condition is false at the end of a successful transition bin sequence matching then the counter is not incremented as before, but the matched result is no more preserved now to increment the bin later when the iff condition becomes true.</li>
 <li>dvt105070 - (results) Assuming that LRM has a typo on missing open square bracket in bin syntax, allowing coverpoint name in binrhs without any with-expression</li>

<ul><li>dvt95876 - (results) The size of verilog real datatype was being printed 0 in VCD files. Corrected this to print 64 as the size of real types in VCD. </li>
 <li>dvt104690 - An issue related to licensing is fixed. The issue caused a hang if the checked-out license feature is about to expire (default is 15 days before expiration). A workaround was to set the 'MGLS_EXP_WARN_DAYS' variable to '1'. Now, the workaround is not needed. This issue was not applicable to Windows platform.</li>

<p /><a name="uidefects"></a><font size="4"><b>User Interface Defects Repaired in 10.7a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt105987 - The "change" command failed to accept variable names with index or select expressions, only in -batch mode.  This issues has bee resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt103413 - The GUI crash reading a wlf file containing SV union nets has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt107688 - In some cases, signals sent from the source window to other windows will not be from the correct scope.  This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>dvt108473 - From the Message Viewer, when opening the source file referenced in a message, if the file cannot be found, a dialog box will pop up, requesting the user to select the location of the file.</li>
 <li>dvt106889 - "vmap" fails silently when there is a leftover lock file.  Now it will report a warning 5 times, 5 seconds apart, before giving up and returning an error status.</li>
 <li>dvt109082 - Repaired GUI crash when associative arrays are present in automatic functions.</li>
 <li>dvt109387 - The Coverage HTML Report dialog box sometimes fails with an "# ** Error: (vsim-4003) Invalid option '-code '." message.  This issue has been repaired.</li>

<p /><a name="verilogdefects"></a><font size="4"><b>SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 10.7a</b></font>
<ul><li>[nodvtid]  - In some cases where a fork..join block contained a nested fork..join_any sub-block, disabling the outer block would not immediately disable the inner block.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - Vopt would sometimes crash in designs with interfaces that imported complex types from packages.</li>
 <li>dvt106952 - (results) In some cases involving if-else constraints, -solvefaildebug[=2] would produce a constraint contradiction report that was confusing, making it difficult to analyze the root cause of the conflict. This issue has been fixed.</li>

 <li>dvt109061 - In some rare cases, randomize() would fail with the following spurious error message: "Invalid random variable in index expression for constraint" -- even in cases where an index expression only referred to constant (non-random) variables. This issue has been fixed.</li>

<p /><a name="vhdldefects"></a><font size="4"><b>VHDL Defects Repaired in 10.7a</b></font>
<ul><li>dvt106202 - An internal error was report in some cases in vcom or vopt if an array signal is indexed or sliced. The index expression or slice expression contains a locally static expression that has a primary is a record or array.  For example:
<br>
<pre>
constant C : integer_vector(0 to 1) := ( 3, 6);
signal   S : std_logic_vector(15 downto 0);
....
   o <= S(C(0)); -- The use of C(0) can cause an internal error
</pre>
</li>
 <li>dvt106288 - If a package contains a generic of the same name as a generic of an entity, and the package is instantiated within the entity, the compiler may incorrectly use the static value of the entity's generic rather than the package's generic when producing code for the package instantiation.</li>
 <li>dvt104870 - A simulator crash could occur if an object was declared with an initial expression that was the name of another object whose initial value was a function call whose return type mark was the predefined attribute SUBTYPE with a prefix that was one of the function input parameters (when that parameter is of an unconstrained composite type).</li>
 <li>dvt107650 - Reference to a package constant defined within a package instance that is itself defined within a simple package could cause the compiler to produce an internal error.</li>
 <li>dvt108324 - The compiler could crash when encountering a composite assignment, where the left-hand side contains a variable whose type is an interface type.</li>

<ul><li>dvt104923 - Incorrect time advance values in the WLF file caused signal transitions to be incorrect in some rare conditions.  This bug generally manifested itself by signals transitions in the wave window showing correctly when zoomed in, but disappearing as one zoomed out, then possibly showing again upon zooming out even further.  This has been fixed, but the bug is in the WLF writer and requires WLF files demonstrating this behavior to be regenerated.</li>

 <li>dvt103053 - Add vlog/vopt -svinputport=compat option to default an input port declared with a type but without the "var" keyword to "wire", as required by the LRM, but only if the type is compatible with a net declaration. The fully LRM compliant option -svinputport=net will default to "wire" even if the type is not compatible with a net declaration ("bit", for example), potentially resulting in compilation errors. The default behavior remains unchanged, which is -svinputport=relaxed, where only a a type that is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single dimension vector type defaults to "wire".</li>
 <li>dvt107371 - For implicit vopt (2-step) flow, detailed -stats output can now be obtained by passing required -stats=* option to -voptargs="" along with -vopt_verbose option in vsim. </li>
