<p /><a name="compatibility"></a><font size="4"><b>Compatibility Issues with Release 2020.1</b></font>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>User Interface  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-18738 - (results) Fixes corner cases that were causing the Colorize system in the Transcript window to malfunction for some customers. Using a color of 0 (Normal) now works as a Start Tag. Also, having an End Tag on another line from its matching Start Tag now correctly cleans up the color escape sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemVerilog  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-57185 - (source)  Added checking for packed array of time. Packed arrays of time are not allowed as per LRM. We were not checking for it in the tool but now we have added the check. So, the packed array of time will result in compiler error. The users need to convert the packed array to unpacked to use arrays of time.</li>
 <li>QSIM-53731 - (source) Macros and symbols defined (with `define) in source files compiled because of -v and -y will no longer persist after the -v and/or -y context is finished with.  Use -svext=+dvydl to reenable the old buggy behavior of leaking such macros/symbols.<br /></li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source)  When a macro definition is found after a pre-processor conditional compiler directive and they share the same line in an HDL file emit a suppressible error. This will guide users to create portable code that will behave similarly across different implementations.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56527 - (source, results) Elaboration files generated with vsim switch -elab are compressed by default. Vsim switch -compress_elab is deprecated now.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54037 - (results)  In some rare cases, randomize() would produce an invalid solution for constraints involving $clog2(). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54639 - (results) Significant improvements have been made to the constraint solver for randomize() scenarios involving constraints with random array indices. Inconsistent behavior related to multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays has been corrected. Solver performance/capacity for these scenarios has also improved.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55295 - (results) In some rare cases involving &quot;unique&quot; constraints, randomize() would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55560 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() scenarios involving $countones constraints would incorrectly return 0 (no solutions) for a scenario that has valid solutions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55627 - (results)  In some rare cases involving equality constraints, randomize() would produce an invalid solution. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55788 - (results) Module instances under for-generate blocks are not initialized with same initialization seed, which can result in non-LRM compliant simulation behavior. A SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;genmodseedfix&quot; has been implemented to address this issue. To enable LRM-compliant seeding of module instances under for-generate blocks, add &quot;-svrandext=+genmodseedfix&quot; to the vsim command line. This extension is enabled by default.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-59880 - (results)  In some cases, randomize() would incorrectly evaluate a 'soft' constraint containing an indexed expression with a random index. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59050 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() calls involving constraints with function calls (having one or more arguments) would be incorrectly evaluated (sometimes resulting in spurious constraint contradiction failures). This issue has been resolved.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58384 - (results)  Significantly improved performance and reduced memory usage related to evaluation of randomize() calls involving large numbers of 'inside' constraint expressions.</li>
 <li>QSIM-61434 - (results)  In some rare cases, a call to randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario that had valid solution(s). This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60784 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario with valid solution(s) involving constraints with random index expressions. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60944 - (results) In some rare cases, randomize() would fail (return 0) for a scenario having valid solution(s) involving 'dist' constraints where the bit-width of the LHS is less than the bit-width of the RHS. This issue has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no solutions when &quot;-solvefaildebug=2&quot; is specified. The diagnostic output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.<br /><br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56092 - (results) Significant improvements to how randomize() calls involving constraints with 'real' type operands are evaluated have been implemented with regard to correctness/repeatability, precision, solution distribution, and performance. Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a
SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license. </li>
 <li>QSIM-60546 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Process names now reflect the value of their initial seed -- this method of identifying processes has been found to be more random-stable than the previous method (which displayed process names the same way as the GUI). Use &quot;-rngtraceopt=guiprocessnames&quot; to instruct RNG Trace to generate process names the old way.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-61128 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Implemented automatic filtering of &quot;noisy&quot; RNG trace output preceding set_randstate() operations. <br /><br />Output being written to a RNG trace file is buffered. When a set_randstate operation (on the executing process) is encountered, a backward scan of the buffered operation is made - looking for the first operation where the input (prior) randstate matches the randstate of the set_randstate operation. If such a operation is found, the matching operation along with the reset operation and intervening operations are filtered (removed from the buffer). Only RNG operations executed from the active process are considered. <br /><p>When the RNG trace is being written to the transcript (rather than to a file), the buffering/filtering will not be performed. This is because the filtering would delay the reporting of RNG operation (within the transcript) and make the reporting confusing.</p><p>The length of the buffer can be controlled by the &quot;-rngtracebuffersize &lt;size&gt;&quot; command line option. Setting a size less than 2 disables the filtering. The default is 20.<br /><br /></p></li>
 <li>QSIM-60157 - (results) Improved the output of the constraint contradiction report generated when randomize() fails and -solvefaildebug is enabled. The output of the &quot;Where&quot; section (which describes variables and expressions that are assigned to a constant value) is now annotated with a comment indicating if a variable is considered &quot;random&quot; or &quot;non-random&quot; at the time randomize() is invoked. This information can be useful when debugging unexpected randomize() failures due to testbench errors related to missing 'rand' keywords on class fields that should be declared random.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59586 - (results) The SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;deepcheck&quot; is now enabled by default. This extension allows randomize(null) calls to recursively consider constraints from member class handles. Use &quot;vsim -svrandext=-deepcheck&quot; to disable this extension.<br /><div><br /></div></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>VHDL  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-52747 - (source)  Fixed an issue where forward type declarations could allow compilation of illegal redefinitions. It is now illegal to declare multiple forward type declarations for the same symbol (see VHDL-2008 5.4.2).</li>
 <li>QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode parameters in the above cases.</li>
 <li>QSIM-50634 - (results)  In certain cases, optimization of clocked processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has been fixed.<div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-55137 - (results)  In certain cases, vopt was crashing during optimization of clocked processes. This bug has been fixed. <div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-56234 - (results)  In certain cases, association of array subelements in ports was leading to incorrect results. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56012 - (results) When attributes 'left, 'right, 'length, 'low, 'high and 'range were applied to an unconstrained array, they lead to a crash. This is now an error.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-58539 - (results)  The attributes <b>INSTANCE_NAME</b> and<b> PATH_NAME</b>, were not considered globally static.  If the prefix of the attribute is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or concurrent statement.  This currently results in extra statement executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different from previous versions. </li>
 <li>QSIM-57969 - (results)  Using a function call without arguments in a generic map was showing syntax error incorrectly. This has been fixed. <div><br /></div></li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>General  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-55189 - (source, results) Added Library Forward SAIF file Support in Questa. Now, with Vopt command-line user can specify :<br /><ol><li>  Library Forward SAIF file with option &quot;-fsaif  &lt;saif_file_name&gt;&quot; or,</li><li>  File containing list of path to multiple Library Forward SAIF files with option &quot;-fsaiflist &lt;file_name&gt;&quot;</li></ol></li>
 <li>QSIM-20282 - (source, results) #QSIM-20282 <br />#Fixed with CL:4256347<br /><br />When an interconnect delay in the SDF file uses two nodes that are not connected, QuestaSim does not issue a warning message and Interconnect request is replaced with a port annotation at the destination. <br /> <br />The LRM specifically states that for interconnect delays, a warning message will	be generated if source and destination ports are not on same net.<br /> <br />Added the below warning in this case in <b>vsim</b>:<br /> Warning: (vsim-SDF-16107) &lt;sdffile_path&gt;(&lt;sdffile_lineno&gt;): The interconnect &lt;source port absolute path&gt; is not connected to the destination '&lt;destination port absolute path&gt; '.<br /> The interconnect request will be replaced with a port annotation at the destination.</li>
</ul>
<p /><dd><font size="3"><b>SystemC  Compatibility</b></font></dd>
<ul><li>QSIM-555 - (source) SystemC/DPI/PLI/VPI/FLI default compiler (GCC) for linux and linux_x86_64 platforms is upgraded to 7.4.0<br />Supported compilers: gcc-7.4.0, gcc-5.3.0 and gcc-4.7.4 for linux and linux_x86_64 platforms </li>
 <li>QSIM-57618 - (source, results) <div>Support for the IEEE 1666-2005 SystemC-2.2 standard has been deprecated and it is no longer supported.</div></li>
 <li>QSIM-57618 - (source, results)  GCC 4.5.0 is no longer supported and It will no longer be distributed with the release. This affects linux and linux_x86_64 platforms only.</li>

 <li>VM-11516 - Removed enforced addition of &quot;/bin&quot; to PATH in vco wrapper script.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-55252 - The vdir command can now be given the name of an already-existing directory; it will transform the directory into a Questa library.  The directory must be empty for this to succeed.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-55060 - Running vopt to re-generate an existing optimized design after the work library had been moved in the file system would sometimes produce an error message involving the original file pathnames.  The behavior has been fixed, and vopt will now re-generate the optimized design.<br /></li>

<ul><li>QSIM-54192 -  A &quot;force -deposit&quot; or $deposit on a net connected to tran primitives failed to take on the forced value.</li>
 <li>QSIM-29891 -  In some cases, invoking randomize() via a dotted path containing a function call (e.g. &quot; r.get_field().randomize() with {...}&quot;) would cause an error or crash during compilation. This issue has been fixed.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-53856 -  Use of the 'inside' operator with an array of 'real' type on the RHS (e.g. &quot;myvar inside { array_of_real }&quot;) would trigger an internal error &quot;==? operator invalid for REAL&quot;. This issue has been fixed.</li>

 <li>QSIM-55187 - Certain lists of expressions, as in a concatenation, could cause a compiler crash if there was a missing element; this is a syntax error now correctly handled.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56462 - An index variable in a streaming concat expression like b1 = {&gt;&gt; {b2 with [0 +: len]}} would sometimes generate an error at vsim time because the variable &quot;len&quot; was expected to be a constant expression.  The typical error was:&lt;br&gt;<br /> ** Error: (vsim-3044) Usage of 'mod.len' inconsistent with 'register' object.<br /> <br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-57185 - (source)  Added checking for packed array of time. Packed arrays of time are not allowed as per LRM. We were not checking for it in the tool but now we have added the check.

<ul><li>QSIM-54334 - References within an uninstantiated package to a locally-defined package instantiation could result in incorrect simulator error messages due to incorrect code generation.</li>
 <li>QSIM-54962 - An object declaration with an initial value (or default value, for signal) that was the parenthesized OPEN reserved word was accepted and resulted in bad code that would crash the simulator.  This is a syntax error that is now detected.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54941 -  The presence of a package instantiation declaration within the declarative region of a design unit could cause the compiler to incorrectly identify the instantiation as a standalone design unit when compiling a source file with a -just command-line switch. As a consequence, it is possible the extracted generic map clause of the instantiation will refer to objects that are not in scope, or the containing design unit will be broken into two parts that cannot be compiled without syntax errors.</li>
 <li>QSIM-50634 - (results)  In certain cases, optimization of clocked processes with reset was leading to incorrect results. This bug has been fixed.<div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-55460 - A VHDL 2008 IF-GENERATE with ELSIF-GENERATE alternative block(s) could cause a simulator crash if vopt could determine that a condition was FALSE.<br /></li>

 <li>[nodvtid]  - FLI function mti_FindDriver() would crash in some situations involving composite signals.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56691 - (source, results) Following execution of uninstantiated procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, and evaluation of generic procedures with OUT mode parameters not associated with a type generic, actual variables associated with the OUT parameters could be left unchanged despite changes within the procedures. The compiler is now generating code to correctly set the value of OUT mode parameters in the above cases.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56234 - (results)  In certain cases, association of array subelements in ports was leading to incorrect results. This has been fixed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56012 - (results) When attributes 'left, 'right, 'length, 'low, 'high and 'range were applied to an unconstrained array, they lead to a crash. This is now an error.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-57546 -  If a package contains a package instance within a USE clause, static array constraints within the package instance may not be compiled correctly, possible causing a fatal internal error during elaboration of  the design by the simulator.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57795 - The compiler could report a fatal internal error if it encountered a generic declaration list with an index constraint within a generic vector preceding an interface package.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58539 - (results)  The attributes <b>INSTANCE_NAME</b> and<b> PATH_NAME</b>, were not considered globally static.  If the prefix of the attribute is a signal and this expression appears in a wait statement with an on clause or in a concurrent statement other than a process, a change in signal value would trigger a evaluation of the wait or concurrent statement.  This currently results in extra statement executions. The attributes are now considered globally static, so the wait or concurrent statement is no longer sensitized to that prefix. This change can cause simulation results to be different from previous versions. </li>
 <li>QSIM-57830 -  Using unconstrained alias signal as an actual for a port connection was leading to a crash. This has been fixed.<div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-57969 - (results)  Using a function call without arguments in a generic map was showing syntax error incorrectly. This has been fixed. <div><br /></div></li>
 <li>QSIM-60023 - Use of the -mixedsvvh switch could result in the compiler erroneously emitting error vcom-1995, which states that a package cannot be imported into SystemVerilog designs. This can occur when at least two VHDL packages are compiled on a single command-line with the -mixedsvvh switch; and, one package contains a constant declaration initialized by a function defined in the other package, and the name of the first package comes lexically before the name of the second package.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57712 -  If an entity has a  generic whose type depends on a previously declared generic and that entity is directly instantiated, then vsim could crash when loading the design. The work around was to use a component instantiation. </li>
 <li>QSIM-60153 -  If a component had a port that is a multi-dimensional array whose bounds depended on the component's generics and the port's actual was an expression, vcom could generate an internal error.</li>
 <li>QSIM-60125 - Simulations can crash, producing a stacktrace, when simulating a VHDL design that calls procedures defined inside an uninstantiated package with signal-valued attribute expressions, using the 'TRANSACTION, 'STABLE, and 'QUIET attributes.</li>
 <li>QSIM-56236 -  Several related problems are fixed<br /><ol><li>Ports that are of a multi-dimensional array type and the index constraints depend on generics would crash.</li><li>Partially constrained ports that are arrays of arrays would crash</li><li>Generic of type array whose constraints depend on other generics would crash.</li></ol>All these issues have been resolved. </li>
 <li>QSIM-59785 - The compiler could generate incorrect code for the mapping of a signal to a component port when the port is an array of records containing unconstrained array fields, and the component instantiation is within a generate block. Incorrect code generation could result in invalid error messages emitted from the compiler, the optimizer, or simulator, or could cause the simulator to crash.</li>
 <li>QSIM-53604 -  VHDL-2008 construct `with &lt;expr&gt; select ?` previously gave error: unimplemented feature. This language construct has now been implemented.</li>
 <li>QSIM-52747 - (source)  Fixed an issue where forward type declarations could allow compilation of illegal redefinitions. It is now illegal to declare multiple forward type declarations for the same symbol (see VHDL-2008 5.4.2).</li>

<ul><li>QSIM-53134 -  Added a SystemVerilog Constraint Solver extension. This extension is to enable the seeding of different module instances differently based on their hierarchical path names. The extension is off by default and can be enabled with vsim -svrandext=pathseed.<br />   </li>
 <li>QSIM-55458 - (results) Significantly improved the output of the constraint contradiction report when randomize() fails due to no solutions when &quot;-solvefaildebug=2&quot; is specified. The diagnostic output related to if/else constraints will be displayed in a fashion that reflects the original constraints for more scenarios.<br /><br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-54662 - Constraint expressions involving multiplication of 'real' type operands are now supported during randomize() when the &quot;realrand&quot; SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default). Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - SystemVerilog macro names defined on the command line may contain the minus ('-') character in addition to the set of characters that form valid identifiers. Enable this extension with the &quot;-svext=+mncim&quot; option.</li>
 <li>[nodvtid]  - (source)  When a macro definition is found after a pre-processor conditional compiler directive and they share the same line in an HDL file emit a suppressible error. This will guide users to create portable code that will behave similarly across different implementations.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57802 - In the elab/load_elab flow, -sv_lib usage is now supported .

 <li>QSIM-55884 - Constraint expressions involving division of 'real' type operands are now supported during randomize() when the &quot;realrand&quot; SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default). Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.</li>
 <li>QSIM-57834 - Distribution constraints involving 'real' type operands are now supported during randomize() when the &quot;realrand&quot; SystemVerilog extension is enabled (default). Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license.If the RHS of a 'dist' constraint specifies a 'real' type range (e.g. &quot;[1.4:2.5]&quot;) then an explicit weight must be specified (implicit default weight of &quot;:= 1&quot; is not supported) and only the &quot;:/&quot; weight operator is supported (the &quot;:=&quot; is not supported for ranges); in addition, the probability for selecting a single value from the specified range is undefined. 'real' types are not supported for 'dist' weight expressions.<br /> </li>
 <li>QSIM-58007 - When -solveverbose or -solveinfo is specified on the vsim command line, the solver will dump information about the constraints which participate in a given randomize() call. In some cases, constraints which contain references to non-random variables would display the names of the variables and not the value of those variables, making it difficult to debug issues related to those constraints. The -solveverbose/-solveinfo output for these kinds of constraints has been improved -- now the value of non-random variables and the names of those variables (as an in-line comment) are displayed.</li>
 <li>QSIM-58407 - Implemented a new feature &quot;RNG Trace&quot; that produces diagnostic output during simulation to assist in the analysis of random-stability issues between two differing simulations. Enable RNG tracing by adding &quot;-rngtrace&quot; to the vsim command line. For additional details and options, refer to the Questa SIM Command Reference Manual (options &quot;-rngtrace&quot;, &quot;-rngtraceopt&quot;, &quot;-rngtraceclassfilter&quot;, &quot;-rngtraceprocessfilter&quot;) and the &quot;Simulator State Variables&quot; Section of the Questa SIM User's Manual (variables &quot;RNGTrace&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceFile&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceOpt&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceClassFilter&quot;, &quot;RNGTraceProcessFilter&quot;)</li>
 <li>QSIM-59275 - Given a randomize() scenario with no solutions, when -solvefaildebug is enabled, a constraint contradiction report is generated representing the minimum-set of contradictory constraints. If a timeout occurred during the determination of the minimum-set, the error message &quot;(vsim-7175) randomize() failed due to a non-reproducible constraint conflict.&quot; was displayed. This error message was found to be confusing and has been improved. The new error message that is displayed when a timeout occurs during -solvefaildebug minimum-set generation is: &quot;(vsim-7097) Timeout while testing for -solvefaildebug constraint conflicts (SolveFailDebugTimeout=50).&quot;<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56092 - (results) Significant improvements to how randomize() calls involving constraints with 'real' type operands are evaluated have been implemented with regard to correctness/repeatability, precision, solution distribution, and performance. Randomization of 'real' variables or constraints requires a
SystemVerilog Real Number Modeling (svrnm) license. </li>
 <li>QSIM-59852 - Given
a randomize() scenario with no solutions, when -solvefaildebug is enabled, a
constraint contradiction report is generated representing the minimum-set of
contradictory constraints. If a timeout occurred during the determination of
the minimum-set, an error message was displayed and no constraint contradiction report (or testcase when -solvefailtestcase is specified) would be generated. This behavior has changed -- if a timeout now occurs during -solvefaildebug minimum-set generation, then a partial constraint contradiction report (and partial testcase) will be generated. The partial results may provide enough information to assist in debugging the constraint contradiction.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-56527 - (source, results) Elaboration files generated with vsim switch -elab are compressed by default. Vsim switch -compress_elab is deprecated now.<br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-58370 - Non-LRM compliant $void system function calls in constraint contexts are now partially supported via the vlog/vopt &quot;voidsystf&quot; SystemVerilog extension.<br /><br />When this extension is enabled, any occurrence of $void(x) within constraint contexts will be evaluated as (x). Occurrences of $void outside of constraint contexts will behave as user-defined system function calls (PLI).<br /><br />This extension is enabled by default. Use vlog/vopt &quot;-svext=-voidsystf&quot; or &quot;-pedanticerrors&quot; to disable this extension. </li>
 <li>QSIM-56526 - Implemented a new randomize() feature - Solver Record and Replay.<br /> <br /><div>Solver record logs the solved values of random variables evaluated by randomize() calls during simulation to a solver recording file. Use &quot;vsim -solverecord[=&lt;filename&gt;]&quot; to enable solver record (solved values will be output to &lt;filename&gt; if specified, or &quot;solver.dat&quot; by default).<br /><br /> Solver replay reads the contents of a solver recording file and applies the stored values of random variables to randomize() calls during simulation. Use &quot;vsim -solvereplay[=&lt;filename&gt;]&quot; to enable solver replay (solved values will be read from &lt;filename&gt; if specified, or &quot;solver.dat&quot; by default).<br /><br /> See section &quot;Solver Record and Replay&quot; in the QuestaSIM User's Manual for additional details.</div></li>
 <li>QSIM-60546 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Process names now reflect the value of their initial seed -- this method of identifying processes has been found to be more random-stable than the previous method (which displayed process names the same way as the GUI). Use &quot;-rngtraceopt=guiprocessnames&quot; to instruct RNG Trace to generate process names the old way.<br /><br /></li>
 <li>QSIM-61128 - (results) RNG Trace (Random Number Generator Trace) feature: Implemented automatic filtering of &quot;noisy&quot; RNG trace output preceding set_randstate() operations. <br /><br />Output being written to a RNG trace file is buffered. When a set_randstate operation (on the executing process) is encountered, a backward scan of the buffered operation is made - looking for the first operation where the input (prior) randstate matches the randstate of the set_randstate operation. If such a operation is found, the matching operation along with the reset operation and intervening operations are filtered (removed from the buffer). Only RNG operations executed from the active process are considered. <br /><p>When the RNG trace is being written to the transcript (rather than to a file), the buffering/filtering will not be performed. This is because the filtering would delay the reporting of RNG operation (within the transcript) and make the reporting confusing.</p><p>The length of the buffer can be controlled by the &quot;-rngtracebuffersize &lt;size&gt;&quot; command line option. Setting a size less than 2 disables the filtering. The default is 20.<br /><br /></p></li>
 <li>QSIM-60157 - (results) Improved the output of the constraint contradiction report generated when randomize() fails and -solvefaildebug is enabled. The output of the &quot;Where&quot; section (which describes variables and expressions that are assigned to a constant value) is now annotated with a comment indicating if a variable is considered &quot;random&quot; or &quot;non-random&quot; at the time randomize() is invoked. This information can be useful when debugging unexpected randomize() failures due to testbench errors related to missing 'rand' keywords on class fields that should be declared random.</li>
 <li>QSIM-59586 - (results) The SystemVerilog constrained-random language extension &quot;deepcheck&quot; is now enabled by default. This extension allows randomize(null) calls to recursively consider constraints from member class handles. Use &quot;vsim -svrandext=-deepcheck&quot; to disable this extension.<br /><div><br /></div></li>
