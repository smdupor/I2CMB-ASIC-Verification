Overview</h1>
<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">For
any given regression run, each Task or Group of Tasks is assigned
a unique working directory and the working directories for the member
Groups and/or Tasks within any given Group are created directly
under that Group's working directory in a manner reflecting the
membership hierarchy defined by the RMDB database. This allows the user
scripts to refer to files maintained on behalf of their parent Group
(that is, the coverage merge file or design library) via relative
path names such as “..” (although that does not preclude the user
from passing that information via parameters defined at the Group
level). Any files generated by VRM in association with a given Action
(that is, Action script files, <span class="ph filepath">.do</span> files, log
files, and so on) are written to the working directory associated
with the Runnable on whose behalf the Action is executed.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">The entire working directory
structure is managed by VRM and is rooted in a top-level <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory
supplied by the user (via the -vrmdata command-line option). By
default, VRM creates and uses as its <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory
a subdirectory called <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> in the directory
from which VRM was invoked (in other words (<span class="ph filepath">%DATADIR%</span>)
defaults to (<span class="ph filepath">%VRUNDIR%)/VRMDATA</span>).</p>
<p class="p">Compile (work) libraries and/or source
files must be visible from the working store of each test. Several
known directory paths are provided as predefined parameters (see <a class="xref fm:PageNumber" href="Concept_PredefinedParameterUsage_iddf078ecb.html#iddf078ecb-d843-425d-8487-8e9ad7d874b5__Concept_PredefinedParameterUsage_iddf078ecb.xml#iddf078ecb-d843-425d-8487-8e9ad7d874b5" title="A small number of parameters are predefined with values equal to certain global paths or names relevant to VRM algorithm.">Predefined Parameter Usage</a>) for use in resolving command parameter
references. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">VRUNDIR</span> parameter
holds the path from which VRM is invoked. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">RMDBDIR</span> parameter
holds the path from which the RMDB database file is read. Either
of these can be used as references for locating design source or
other mostly static data files. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">VRMDATA</span> parameter
holds the root directory of the <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> (working)
directory tree, providing a convenient place to store compiled libraries
common to the entire regression. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">TASKDIR</span> parameter
holds the path to the working directory associated with the current
Action that can be used as a reference to locate runtime-generated data
or result files.</p>
