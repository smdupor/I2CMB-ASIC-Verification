If the compile step fails for some reason, the simulations will also be unlikely to succeed and, thus, executing them would be a waste of disk space and compute capacity. VRM is capable of pruning the execution graph in response to failed Actions. This it not unlike the behavior of the make utility when faced with a failing build step.
