<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract MGCAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">At the highest
level, VRM takes one or more regression suite names given on the
command line, expands them (using information in the RMDB database) into
a list of Actions that must be executed in some sequence, executes
each Action in turn, and then reports the outcome of the entire
regression run. The sequence in which the Actions are executed depends
on their grouping in the RMDB database. In order to discern the
proper execution sequence, the selected Runnables are expanded into
Actions using a directed acyclic graph (referred to as the “execution
graph”). The nodes of the graph represent Actions (that is, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span>, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>,
and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span>)
to be executed. The vertices of the graph encode the dependencies
between these Actions (that is, a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
depends on the completion of the various <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions
required for the members of the group to which it belongs).</span>
</div>
<p class="p">For each Action executed, VRM
manages the working directory, creates any necessary execution scripts,
and launches the Actions. It is informed of the completion of each
Action and, in the case of <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions
that represent simulations, performs some preliminary triage (pass/fail
analysis). It also handles timeouts and determines (based on an
optional heuristic) whether the regression run should be allowed
to progress. The sections below discuss the details involved.</p>
<p class="p">A description of the algorithms used
to execute and analyze each Action script can be found in the chapters
on “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="Contain_ScriptExecutionTimeouts_idb739d4ac.html#idb739d4ac-9481-43c5-926f-7459c31ccc52__Contain_ScriptExecutionTimeouts_idb739d4ac.xml#idb739d4ac-9481-43c5-926f-7459c31ccc52" title="Once the RMDB database has been read and the requested Runnables have been expanded to form the execution graph, a completion event is posted to the special =init= Action. This causes one or more Actions to become eligible for execution (that is, their dependencies having been completed). The Actions directly dependent on the =init= Action are generally the preScript Actions of the top-most Group(s) selected via the command line. Actions that are eligible for execution are added to a run queue. An inner loop periodically removes Actions from this queue and executes them. A list of currently executing Actions is also maintained, in which the expected completion time (execution time plus the minimum timeout value for that Action) is recorded. As each Action reports completion, it is removed from the currently executing list and from the graph. The vertices of the graph beginning at the completed node are followed to determine what Actions, if any, can be eligible to run next. If a vertex from the completed Action happens to be the last such vertex into the node at the opposite end, that opposite-end node also becomes eligible to run and is added to the eligible Action run queue.">Script Execution and Timeouts</a>” and “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_PostExecutionAnalysis_id449d612e.html#id449d612e-5515-4308-9fa5-16ffa2ef6f58__MGCChap_PostExecutionAnalysis_id449d612e.xml#id449d612e-5515-4308-9fa5-16ffa2ef6f58" title="After generating the necessary files, vrun launches the Action and waits for the “done” message to arrive from the wrapper script for that Action, indicating that the user's script has exited and returned control to the wrapper. From this point until vrun continues with the next Action is called “post-execution analysis.” The behavior of VRM as it analyzes and reacts to the results of each completed Action is highly customized. Therefore, most of the steps involved in post-execution analysis are user-definable, with reasonable default behavior for the common case.">Post-execution Analysis</a>”. </p>
