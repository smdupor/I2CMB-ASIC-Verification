from Action Scripts</h1>
<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">Some
Action nodes are marked for special handling in the event of failure.
A failure can be detected by a non-zero return status from the user
script for that Action, or it can be the result of the post-execution
pass/fail analysis performed after a simulation. In either case,
a failure can (depending on the circumstances) cause other Actions
in the execution graph to be skipped.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">The most obvious case is the
failure of a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action.
Since a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
usually contains compilation or other preparatory steps required
for the successful execution of the Action scripts associated with
the members of the Group with which the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> is
associated, failure of a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
will cause all “downstream” Actions (that is, all Actions associated
with members of the Group or their dependents) to be skipped. The
Action's failure is reported to the vrun log output and, in verbose
reporting mode, the skipped Actions will list the failing <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
as the cause of their non-execution.</p>
<p class="p">In the case of a sequential Group, it
is also assumed that successful completion of each member of the
Group is necessary to ensure the successful execution of further
members of that same sequential Group. For this reason, a failing
member of a sequential Group will cause all Actions associated with
(or dependent upon) subsequent members of that same Group to be skipped.
As with a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> failure,
the failing Action is reported to the vrun log output and, in verbose
reporting mode, the skipped Actions will list the failing Action
that was the cause of their non-execution.</p>
<p class="p">If any member of a sequential Group happens
to be another Group (sequential or non-sequential), the “failure”
of the member Group is determined by the pass/fail status of the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
at the end of that Group. The rationale for this is that a non-sequential
Group can have one or more failures among its members and still
be able to successfully complete its mission (which might be the
merging of the coverage results of its members, including the pass/fail
status of each member). In any Group, it is up to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
of that Group to determine whether the failure of one or more of
that Group's members constitutes failure of the Group as a whole.
In the case where there is no <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
defined, a sequential Group is considered to have failed if any
of its members (or its <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span>)
failed whereas a non-sequential Group will only be considered to
have failed if its <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action failed.</p>

The sequence in which the Actions are executed depends on their grouping in the RMDB database. In order to discern the proper execution sequence, the selected Runnables are expanded into Actions using a directed acyclic graph (referred to as the “execution graph”). The nodes of the graph represent Actions (that is, preScript, execScript, and postScript) to be executed. The vertices of the graph encode the dependencies between these Actions (that is, a postScript Action depends on the completion of the various execScript Actions required for the members of the group to which it belongs).">Execution Graph and Advanced Topology</a></div>
