<div class="body conbody ConceptBody"><div class="abstract ConceptAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">The two examples
above assume that the pre-existing script exists in a subdirectory
of the directory from which vrun was launched. The pre-existing
script is executed from that location by the Action script. However,
one of the key reasons for copying the parameter-expanded Action
script into the working directory is so the tests can be rerun manually
under the same conditions as those under which they were run by
VRM. If the pre-existing script is not present in the working directory,
then some of that advantage is lost (or, at the very least, the
user needs to make sure the pre-existing scripts remained accessible
from their original paths).</span>
</div>
<p class="p">One option the user has to circumvent
this issue, and more clearly document exactly how an Action is executed,
is to copy the pre-existing script into the working directory and
run it from there. This is simply a matter of adding the relevant
commands to the Action script definition. In the case of the position-dependent
example above, the Action script could be rewritten as follows:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;execScript launch="exec"&gt;
	&lt;command&gt;if [ ! -e myscript.csh ]; then&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;command&gt;  cp -p (%VRUNPATH%)/scripts/myscript.csh 
			 myscript.csh&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;command&gt;fi&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;command&gt;myscript.csh (%top%) (%dofilename%) (%ucdbname%)&lt;/command&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">The conditional test is an optimization to
make sure the copy is only done in the case of a new working directory
(one that is lacking in the necessary script file).</p>
<p class="p">Note that the user can also use a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">localfile</span> element
in the Runnable associated with the Action to copy the pre-existing
script into the working directory. See “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="Contain_LocalFileGeneration_ida2a8f096.html#ida2a8f096-abfd-4ea1-92a9-c628274a4d72__Contain_LocalFileGeneration_ida2a8f096.xml#ida2a8f096-abfd-4ea1-92a9-c628274a4d72" title="A Runnable can define one or more local files that are generated, copied, or linked into the working directory prior to the execution of any Action scripts in that directory. Each local file to be generated into the working directory is designated by a corresponding localfile element contained within the runnable element with which it is associated. An optional src attribute specifies the file or directory from which the contents of the local file are to be taken. If the src attribute is not specified, then the contents of the localfile element itself are used to generate the local file.">Local File Generation</a>” for details.</p>
