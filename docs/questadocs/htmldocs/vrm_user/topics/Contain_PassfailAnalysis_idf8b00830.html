<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">Before
vrun can decide how to react to a completed Action, it must determine
if the Action in question passed or failed. For purposes of pass/fail
analysis, each <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action
is assumed to run, at most, one simulation. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
are assumed not to run simulations (the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
are primarily used for compile, setup, and/or post-processing commands).
These assumptions can be overridden in the RMDB database as described below.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">In order to determine
the status of a simulation, it is necessary to locate the UCDB file
associated with that simulation in order to read its test data record.
For an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action,
the easiest way to specify the name and location of the UCDB file
is to specify a value for the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">ucdbfile</span> parameter
either in the Task itself, in a base runnable associated with the
Task, or in a parent Group (as described in “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="Contain_InheritanceOverridesSearchOrder_id01f79c08.html#id01f79c08-5fab-42f9-a986-e7565254673c__Contain_InheritanceOverridesSearchOrder_id01f79c08.xml#id01f79c08-5fab-42f9-a986-e7565254673c" title="When considering the configuration of most regression suites, there is usually some degree of repetition. If, for example, 100 tests all require the same simulation commands with some minor variation, it would be a poor system that forced the user to specify the redundant information 100 times, once per test.">Inheritance, Overrides, and Search Order</a>”). This parameter can, itself,
contain nested parameter references (as can all parameters) and
its value can also be used as the argument for the coverage save
command in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>.
For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;runnable type="task" name="test1"&gt;
	&lt;parameters&gt;
		&lt;parameter name="top"&gt;top&lt;/parameter&gt;
		&lt;parameter name="seed"&gt;123&lt;/parameter&gt;
		&lt;parameter name="ucdbfile"&gt;../test(%seed%).ucdb&lt;/parameter&gt;
	&lt;/parameters&gt;
	 ...
	&lt;execScript&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;vsim -lib ../work -sv_seed (%seed%) -c (%top%)&lt;/command&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;coverage attribute -name TESTNAME -value 
				test(%seed%)&lt;/command&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;coverage save -onexit (%ucdbfile%)&lt;/command&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;run -all&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;/execScript&gt;
	 ...
&lt;/runnable&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">In this case, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">ucdbfile</span> parameter
depends on the value of the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">seed</span> parameter.
The simulation Tasks in this particular group are also designed
to save their UCDB files in the working directory of their parent
Group. Therefore, the UCDB filename comes out, in the case of “test1”
above, to ../<span class="ph filepath">test123.ucdb</span>. This string is substituted
in place of the (<span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">%ucdbfile%</span>)
parameter reference in the script (to save the UCDB file), and is
also used by VRM to determine the status of the simulation. If the <span class="ph filepath">ucdbfile</span> is
a relative path, it is assumed to be relative to the working directory
from which the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action
was executed.</p>
<p class="p">In the implementation, if a UCDB
file is not specified for a given <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action,
then that Action is not included in the pass/fail analysis. If a
UCDB file is specified but cannot be found, or if the test data
record cannot be read, then the Action is counted as having failed
with the status “UCDB error.”</p>
<p class="p">The default pass/fail analysis
process assumes that the Action in question represents a single
simulation. Therefore, it also assumes that there is only one test
data record in the UCDB file. If multiple test data records are
found in the UCDB file, only the first test data record is read
and the rest are silently ignored. If UCDBs with multiple test data
records must be examined as part of the pass/fail analysis, then
a user-defined procedure should be used to override the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">AnalyzePassFail</span> behavior.</p>
<p class="p">The numeric status code returned
from the Action script is also passed to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">AnalyzePassFail</span> procedure.
By default, if the status code returned from the Action script is
non-zero, the Action is automatically considered to have failed
and the UCDB is not consulted.</p>

The vcover merge executable is used without any additional options. In addition, the log output of the vcover executable defaults to stdout, and is echoed to any explicitly supplied log file.

In this case, early termination of the regression run can prevent processing resources from being wasted on simulations that cannot provide any additional information.

The user can override this behavior and provide a heuristic function that will terminate a regression run prematurely in the face of such catastrophic failure.">StopRunning Concept</a></strong></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Concept_Stoppropagating_ida43897a2.html" title="A typical regression suite consists of a large number of inter-related Actions. Many of those Actions depend on the successful completion of previous Actions in the suite. For example, one of the uses of the preScript Action is to compile the Design Under Test (DUT) in preparation for running the actual simulations. If the compile step fails for some reason, the simulations will also be unlikely to succeed and, thus, executing them would be a waste of disk space and compute capacity. VRM is capable of pruning the execution graph in response to failed Actions. This it not unlike the behavior of the make utility when faced with a failing build step. Unless otherwise directed, the default behavior of make is to stop the build on the first error encountered.">StopPropagating Concept</a></strong></li>
