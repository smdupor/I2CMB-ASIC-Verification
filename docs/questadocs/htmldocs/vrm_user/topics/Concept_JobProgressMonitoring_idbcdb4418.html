<div class="body conbody ConceptBody"><div class="abstract ConceptAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">The VRM algorithm
can be divided into two basic functions. The first, somewhat trivial
function is to build a list of Actions that need to be executed.
This happens once when VRM is first executed. The second, more complex
function is to listen for job completions and kick off subsequent
rounds of Actions as they become eligible to run. This second function
is mainly triggered in response to a “done” message being received
from an existing job (exceptions are made for the initial round
of eligible Actions that are triggered by a synthetic “done” message
on the pseudo-Action <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">=init=</span> and for
timeouts, which are handled as if a “done” message had occurred
but in response to the lapse of a preset time interval).</span>
</div>
<p class="p">In order to receive these “done”
messages and use them to launch Actions in the proper sequence,
the initiating VRM process must remain alive for the duration of
each regression run. This process maintains an open TCP/IP socket
via which running jobs, possibly executing on servers other than
that on which VRM was invoked, can communicate their “done” message
upon completion. Specifically, each job is provided with a server
address and the TCP port number opened by the VRM process that kicked
off the job. This information is actually written into the wrapper
script for the Action. When a job completes, it passes a unique
identifier and the <span class="ph filepath">port@host</span> string to a newly
invoked VRM instance (in notification mode) that then connects to
the open socket on the initiating VRM to communicate the “done”
message. The initiating VRM process will then update its internal
data structures and launch subsequent Actions as needed. VRM tracks
the yet-to-be-completed jobs (running Actions) and exits when the
last of the Actions resulting from the user-specified regression
run has been executed.</p>
<p class="p">This communication process is independent of
any global status monitor (that is, JobSpy or the monitor software
supplied with the grid system). The user can continue to use any
global monitor tools with VRM without fear of interfering with its
normal operation.</p>
