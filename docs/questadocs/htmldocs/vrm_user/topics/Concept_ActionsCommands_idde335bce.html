<div id="BodyContent"><h1 class="title topictitle1">Actions and Commands</h1>
<div class="body conbody ConceptBody"><div class="abstract ConceptAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">There are three
kinds of Actions defined in the database: <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span>, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>,
and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span>.
A leaf-level Task can define an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> that
contains the commands necessary to carry out the Task in question.
A Group can define a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and/or
a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span>.
The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> consists
of the commands that are run prior to invoking the Tasks and/or
Groups listed as members in the Group in question. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript </span>consists
of the commands that are run after all the Tasks and/or Groups contained
in said Group have completed. Each of these Actions is associated
with a script defined in the RMDB database. Each script is made
up of zero or more commands. If an Action script is not defined
for a particular Test or Group, or if the Action script contains
no commands, then the Action is skipped and nothing is executed
at that stage in the run.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">When a given Action is to be executed,
the commands for that Action are copied to a script file in the
working directory for that Action. By default, the commands in each
Action are assumed to be TCL commands.</p>
<p class="p">A <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">launch</span> attribute
can be added to the element corresponding to any Action to indicate
how the commands in the corresponding script are to be launched.
If the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">launch</span> attribute
is set to <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">exec</span>,
then the script file is launched from <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">vish</span> using
the TCL exec command.</p>
<p class="p">When you set the launch attribute to vsim,
or if you do not specify the launch attribute, the action executes
the script file from within vsim using the “do” command. When you
set the launch attribute to vsim you can also specify any vsim arguments
to affect the way in which the vsim shell opens, prior to executing
the script file. For example:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;execScript launch="vsim -lic_vlog -lic_noqueue"&gt;
	...
&lt;/execScript&gt;
</code></pre><p class="p">which instructs vsim to perform the specified
licensing tasks before opening the vsim shell.</p>
<p class="p">If the launch attribute is set to any other
value, then the setting is used as the path to the “shell” to be
launched in order to interpret the script commands. This shell command,
if specified, is launched from vish using the following TCL command:</p>
<p class="lines ApplCommand">exec $launch $script</p>
<p class="p">Rather than defining commands, a given Action
definition can point to a file using the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">file</span> attribute.
The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">file</span> attribute
contains the absolute or relative path to a file containing the
Action script. If the path is not absolute, it is assumed to be
relative to the directory from which the database was read. When
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">file</span> attribute
is given, the commands that make up the Action are read, line-by-line,
from the file in question. If the file does not exist or is not readable,
then an error is issued and the Action is abandoned. Each command
in the file is treated as if it is a command appearing in the database
for that Action and is subject to parameter expansion (see “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_ParametersParameterExpansion_id68da1844.html#id68da1844-ab5a-4671-86d0-234a9b5ae99e__MGCChap_ParametersParameterExpansion_id68da1844.xml#id68da1844-ab5a-4671-86d0-234a9b5ae99e" title="Each Runnable definition (that is, each runnable element) can include a list of zero or more parameter element definitions. A parameter is nothing more than a name/value pair that allows multiple Tasks to share the same execution script (or multiple Groups to share the same Task) by providing unique per-Group or per-Task values to be used in the scripts.">Parameters and Parameter Expansion</a>”).</p>
<p class="p">By default, the commands in the file are assumed
to be TCL commands. However, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">launch</span> attribute
can be used to control the launching of the Action script in the
same manner as for commands defined in the RMDB database.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
for any given Group must be defined within that Group (if not, the
Actions are skipped). When resolving the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> for
a leaf-level Task, however, the entire calling chain is consulted
in reverse order until an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> is found
(see “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="Contain_InheritanceOverridesSearchOrder_id01f79c08.html#id01f79c08-5fab-42f9-a986-e7565254673c__Contain_InheritanceOverridesSearchOrder_id01f79c08.xml#id01f79c08-5fab-42f9-a986-e7565254673c" title="When considering the configuration of most regression suites, there is usually some degree of repetition. If, for example, 100 tests all require the same simulation commands with some minor variation, it would be a poor system that forced the user to specify the redundant information 100 times, once per test.">Inheritance, Overrides, and Search Order</a>” for details). That allows the
user to define a common <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> for
all the Tasks in a Group by defining the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action in
the Group itself. When VRM tries to resolve the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> for
a given Task and none is found, it checks each calling (parent)
Group on up the calling chain looking for a common <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> definition.
If none is found, then the Action is skipped and a warning message
is generated.</p>
<p class="p">Note that if the Runnable in question is a
Task and no <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> element
can be found for that Task, then VRM issues a warning. However,
if the Runnable is a Group and either the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> or <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> is undefined,
then no message is emitted. The theory is that while Groups can
be used for simple grouping (in which case, there cannot be any <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> or <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
to be performed), a Task without an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> is
powerless and thus, less likely to be the result of an intentional
omission.</p>
