<div class="body conbody ConceptBody"><div class="abstract ConceptAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">When running
a random simulation, a random seed can be supplied to vsim via a
command-line option. The simulator guarantees that the same design
run twice with the same seed will produce the same results. This
is known as “random stability” and is essential to allow bugs exhibited
by purely random simulations to be reproduced and debugged. When
a series of random simulations are executed for the purpose of locating
seeds with good coverage (or which turn up corner-case bugs), it
is common to pass the word “random” to the simulation as a seed,
as opposed to a fixed numeric seed value. This tells the simulator
to select a seed at random at the start of the simulation. Of course,
if a test is run twice with the word “random” as the seed, the results
of the second run will almost certainly not match the results of
the original run.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">This becomes a problem for the
failure rerun algorithm. The purpose of the rerun is usually to
execute the simulation a second time, possibly with additional visibility or
trace/dump options enabled, in order to give the user a head start
at debugging any failures. This purpose is thwarted if the second
run differs significantly from the initial failing run. To solve
this problem, vrun has a mechanism whereby it can capture the seed
from the initial (random seed) run and use that to override the
random seed value for the second run, thus re-establishing random
stability across the two runs.</p>
<p class="p">In order to accomplish this, the “done” record
in the event log records the seed used for each simulation. It reads
this seed from the test data record of the UCDB file for the test
in question (if no UCDB file is defined for a given Action, no seed
is recorded). When the -select option is used to select Runnables
from a previous event log file for execution, the seeds are also
read from the event log. This happens regardless of the status of
tests being selected (that is, if the option is -select all, then
all tests from the previous run are re-executed, each one with the same
random seed used in the initial run of that test). By default, any
time the -select command-line option is used to select tests to
rerun, the random seeds for each test are reused for those tests
so selected.</p>
<p class="p">The default behavior is that the random seed
is always reused when a test is re-executed in the same VRM regression
run regardless of whether the local rerun or global rerun mechanism
triggered the rerun.</p>
<p class="p">If this default behavior is not desirable for
some reason, the -noreuseseeds option disables the propagation of
seed values from the previous run to the current run. The option
to not reuse the random seeds is global to that run (that is, if
-noreuseseeds is specified, no seeds from the previous run is propagated
forward to the current run). Note that the behavior relies on the UCDB
test data record so a test that does not generate a UCDB file, or
whose UCDB file has been altered or deleted before vrun has a chance
to retrieve the seed, will not reuse earlier seeds on subsequent
runs. In other words, if there is no UCDB, then there is no seed reuse.</p>
