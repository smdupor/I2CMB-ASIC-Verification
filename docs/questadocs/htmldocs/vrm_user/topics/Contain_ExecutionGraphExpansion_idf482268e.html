Group, a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
node is placed into the execution graph. Then the list of Group
members is enumerated and each is handled in turn (recursively).
The lead Action of each member (either <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> or <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>)
is marked as depending on the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> of
the Group under consideration. Finally, a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
node is placed into the graph and marked as depending on the trailing
Action (similarly, either an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> or
another <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span>)
of each member of the Group.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="idf482268e-d172-415b-9f7f-0dccdb54661d__id3365866c-e306-49b8-8148-826c1a74ba05"><p class="p">In the case of a sequential Group,
a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
node is placed into the execution graph. As the list of Group members
is enumerated, the lead Action of each is marked as depending on
the trailing Action of the previous member (the lead Action of the
first member is marked as being dependent on the sequential Group's <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> node).
A <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
is then placed into the graph and marked as being dependent on the
trailing Action of the last member of the Group.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">By nesting this handling behavior recursively
for each member of any Groups that are encountered, the resulting
graph contains a complete list of Actions to be executed and the vertices
of the graph are set up to ensure that the <span class="ph filepath">preScript/execScript/postScript</span> dependencies
of both sequential and non-sequential Groups are honored. The leading
Action of each Runnable named on the command line is marked as depending
on a special predefined node called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">=init=</span>.</p>
<p class="p">For example, suppose your regression
run consisted of a single non-sequential Group called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> with
three Task members, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test1</span>, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test2</span>,
and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test3</span>.
A special pseudo-node called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">=init=</span> represents
the beginning of the regression run (see <a class="xref fm:FigureAndPage" href="Concept_ExecutionGraphExample_id7f8ba545.html#id7f8ba545-a31f-4985-a204-ace0d4c8f1fc__id42d8578f-d2a5-445e-a658-cfdd4c742abf">Figure 1</a>). After expansion, a single
vertex from <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">=init=</span> would
lead to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
for the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> Group.
From there, three vertices would lead to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions
corresponding to each of the three member Tasks. From each of these <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions,
a single vertex each (three in all) would lead to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> of
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> Group.
What this implies is that the three <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions
can only start after the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> Group's <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Action
has completed and that the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> Group's <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
can only start after all three of the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions
associated with the member Tasks have completed. The three <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions,
however, can be run in any sequence and can be concurrently queued
to a server farm as parallel jobs (since there is no dependency
relationship among the three <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> nodes).
The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> will
most likely contain compile or other preparatory steps necessary
to prepare the simulations to be run. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Actions
will most likely represent three simulations. The final <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Action
will probably perform any wrap-up activities (like coverage merging).
By further subdividing a regression suite into nested Groups, one
can emulate any reasonable set of dependency requirements.</p>
<p class="p">All of this processing depends on the
repeat, foreach, and conditional membership algorithms. As the execution
graph is constructed, each Runnable is examined to see if: (a) it can
repeat, or (b) it can be disabled.</p>
<p class="p">In the case of a repeating Task or Group
(<span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">repeat/foreach</span>),
the handling normally afforded said Task or Group is repeated to satisfy
the repeat count or the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">foreach</span> token
list, as though the Runnable in question had been included that
number of times in the membership list if its parent Group (or on
the command-line, in the case of a top-level Runnable). How to specify repeating
Runnables is discussed in â<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_RmdbDatabaseTopology_id46a4dcaa.html#id46a4dcaa-220c-4e20-8015-5d0c86eb8a88__MGCChap_RmdbDatabaseTopology_id46a4dcaa.xml#id46a4dcaa-220c-4e20-8015-5d0c86eb8a88" title="The RMDB database contains the information required to expand one or more selected Tasks or Groups of tasks, invoked by name on the command line, into one or more individual Actions that are to be executed.">RMDB Database Topology</a>â.</p>
<p class="p">If a Runnable specifies conditional membership
(that is, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">if/unless</span>),
the Runnable is either processed as above if the conditional test
passes, or ignored if the conditional test fails. How to specify
conditional Runnables is discussed in â<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_RmdbDatabaseTopology_id46a4dcaa.html#id46a4dcaa-220c-4e20-8015-5d0c86eb8a88__MGCChap_RmdbDatabaseTopology_id46a4dcaa.xml#id46a4dcaa-220c-4e20-8015-5d0c86eb8a88" title="The RMDB database contains the information required to expand one or more selected Tasks or Groups of tasks, invoked by name on the command line, into one or more individual Actions that are to be executed.">RMDB Database Topology</a>â.</p>

The sequence in which the Actions are executed depends on their grouping in the RMDB database. In order to discern the proper execution sequence, the selected Runnables are expanded into Actions using a directed acyclic graph (referred to as the âexecution graphâ). The nodes of the graph represent Actions (that is, preScript, execScript, and postScript) to be executed. The vertices of the graph encode the dependencies between these Actions (that is, a postScript Action depends on the completion of the various execScript Actions required for the members of the group to which it belongs).">Execution Graph and Advanced Topology</a></div>
