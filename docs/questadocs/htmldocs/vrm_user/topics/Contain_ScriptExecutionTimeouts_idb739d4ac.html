and Timeouts</h1>
<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">Once
the RMDB database has been read and the requested Runnables have
been expanded to form the execution graph, a completion event is
posted to the special <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">=init=</span> Action.
This causes one or more Actions to become eligible for execution
(that is, their dependencies having been completed). The Actions directly
dependent on the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">=init=</span> Action
are generally the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> Actions
of the top-most Group(s) selected via the command line. Actions
that are eligible for execution are added to a run queue. An inner
loop periodically removes Actions from this queue and executes them.
A list of currently executing Actions is also maintained, in which
the expected completion time (execution time plus the minimum timeout
value for that Action) is recorded. As each Action reports completion,
it is removed from the currently executing list and from the graph.
The vertices of the graph beginning at the completed node are followed
to determine what Actions, if any, can be eligible to run next.
If a vertex from the completed Action happens to be the last such
vertex into the node at the opposite end, that opposite-end node
also becomes eligible to run and is added to the eligible Action
run queue.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">VRM continues to execute its
inner loop as long as at least one Action remains in either the
eligible queue or the currently running list. When all the Actions
in the eligible queue have been launched, VRM scans the currently
running list to see if any launched jobs have passed their timeout
limit. If a job times out, an error is emitted and a completion event
is posted for the Action associated with the timed-out job. A timeout
is considered a failure.</p>
<p class="p">Once there are no further Actions in
the currently running list and no more eligible Actions in the eligible
queue, the run is declared complete. If any nodes still exist in
the run graph, they are squawked to the output with an error message
(this should only happen if nodes were placed in the graph and not
properly connected to other nodes or if the graph following algorithm
is faulty). It is also possible that some nodes would remain in
the graph and be squawked in the event the regression run is terminated
prematurely due to errors. In this case, the graph node dump serves
to notify the user that some Actions were never executed. </p>

This includes scripts defined in the RMDB database and scripts pointed to by the file attribute of the script element.

<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Contain_ScriptReturnValues_id223029b1.html" title="Each Action script has a return value that indicates, at a coarse level, whether the commands contained in the script encountered any errors. This return value is communicated to the launching vrun instance for use in pass/fail analysis. This function can require some cooperation from the (user's) Action script in order to correctly communicate the status of commands contained in the Action script.">Script Return Values</a></strong></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Concept_PipeBasedCommandLaunching_ide8ae12f0.html" title="By default, VRM launches scripts as background processes. Their only means of communicating errors back to the launching vrun process is the TCP/IP port on which the vrun process is listening. If the process simply fails to launch (for example, if the vsim or vish processes cannot be found), VRM will detect a launch error and treat the corresponding Action as it would any other failed job. If, however, the wrapper command launches as expected but fails to execute the wrapper script (for example, in the case of an error originating in a faulty method command), VRM could miss the error. In this case, the only recourse is a timeoutQ violation (that is, the timeout window between launching the Action and receiving the “start” message from the wrapper). By default, this delay is 31 seconds. It must be made longer in the case of a grid-based method command. After a timeout, the offending error condition will most likely be reported in the (xxx)Script.stderr file that is also echoed to the vrun log output.">Pipe-based Command Launching</a></strong></li>
