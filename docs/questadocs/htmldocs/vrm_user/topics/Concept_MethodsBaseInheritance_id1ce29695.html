can appear at the top-level of the RMDB file, as children of the
document (<span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">rmdb</span>)

These <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements
cannot be used to satisfy an execution method search. They exist
only as base methods to be referred to by other <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements.
Any <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements
referred to via the base inheritance chain is searched for by name
at the top-level of the database. Since attributes are never inherited,
the only use of base execution methods is to provide a common execution
method command for multiple <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method </span>elements
defined within the various runnable elements. For example, in order
to assign the same execution method to two subsets of the regression
suite (but not the entire suite), the following pattern can be used:</span>
</div>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;rmdb&gt;
	&lt;method name="grid"&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;qsub -V -cwd -b yes (%WRAPPER%)&lt;/command&gt;

	&lt;runnable name="long-tests" type="group"&gt;

		 ...
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	 ...
	&lt;runnable name="big-tests" type="group"&gt;
		&lt;method base="grid"/&gt;
		 ...
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	 ...
&lt;/rmdb&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">A base <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
referred to by another <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
is never consulted during the search for a matching execution method.
It is only consulted in order to locate the appropriate launch command
and other component parts of a matching <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
once the referring <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
has been selected (assuming the selected <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
did not define those component parts itself). Conditions on <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements found
at the top-level of the RMDB file are ignored, as are anonymous <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements
defined at the top-level of the RMDB file.</p>
<p class="p">Note that the base Runnables of a given
Runnable are searched for matching <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements.
But, unless a given <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
matches, any base <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
to which it refers is not consulted. And, once the initially matching <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
is selected, the condition attributes on any base <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements
consulted in the search for a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element
to use for the execution method are ignored.</p>
<p class="p">Following is an example illustrating this
point:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;rmdb&gt;
	&lt;method name="build"&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;rsh bigmachine (%WRAPPER%)&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;/method&gt;
	&lt;method name="grid"&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;qsub -V -cwd -b yes (%WRAPPER%)&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;/method&gt;
	 ...
	&lt;runnable name="normal-group" type="base"&gt;
		&lt;method name="comp" action="preScript" base="build"/&gt;
		&lt;method name="sim" action="execScript" base="grid"/&gt;
		 ...
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="mygroup" type="group" base="normal-group"&gt;
		&lt;members&gt;
			&lt;member&gt;mytask&lt;/member&gt;
		&lt;/members&gt;
		&lt;execScript&gt;
			&lt;command&gt;vsim -coverage top&lt;/command&gt;
		&lt;/execScript&gt;
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="mytask" type="task"&gt;
		 ...
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
		 ...
&lt;/rmdb&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">When the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action
for the Task <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mytask</span> is
executed, a search for a matching execution method is initiated
at the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">runnable</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mytask</span> (even
though the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> element
itself was actually inherited from another Runnable). Since the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mytask</span> Runnable
defines no execution methods itself, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mygroup</span> Runnable
is consulted as the immediate group ancestor (that is, parent) of
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mytask</span> Runnable.
The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mygroup</span> Runnable,
via its base Runnable <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">normal-group</span>,
defines two <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements,
one conditional on the Action type being a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and
one conditional on it being an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>.
Because the Action in question is an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>,
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sim</span> <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
to launch the Action is selected. However, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sim</span> <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element defines
no command. But because it does define a base method (<span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span>),
VRM looks for a top-level method element by that name. Within that <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
we find the qsub command for launching the Action onto a server
grid. This becomes the execution method of choice and the <span class="ph filepath">execScript</span> script
is posted to the grid using the qsub command provided.</p>
<p class="p">This example illustrates several practices
recommended in the paragraphs above. First, both the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> itself
and the method used to launch it are “owned” by the Group Runnable
of which the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mytask</span> Task
is a member. Presumably, this Group includes other members that
will also use the same <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> and
execution method, possibly differing only in the values of some
parameters unique to each Task (that is, to each simulation). The
second thing to note is that the list of conditional methods is
actually defined in a base Runnable that can be reused elsewhere
in the regression suite (presumably for another Group that shares
the same execution method configuration). The last point is that
the conditional execution methods in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">normal-group</span> base
Runnable do not themselves define commands but simply “point” to
base <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements defined
at the top-level of the database. So there could be an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">abnormal-group</span> base
Runnable somewhere in the regression suite that defines a slightly different
set of conditional execution methods but uses the same commands
(that is, points to the same base <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements)
for some or all of the conditional execution methods.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to remember that the test for
a matching conditional execution method and the search for a command
defined by that method are two separate operations. In the following example,
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">build</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span> methods
have both been modified to add additional conditions:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;rmdb&gt;
	&lt;method name="build" action="execScript"&gt;&lt;!-- condition is ignored... 
			  see below --&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;rsh bigmachine (%WRAPPER%)&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;/method&gt;
	&lt;method name="grid" runnable="anothergroup"&gt;&lt;!-- condition is 
			 ignored... see below --&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;qsub -V -cwd -b yes (%WRAPPER%)&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;/method&gt;
	 ...
	&lt;runnable name="normal-group" type="base"&gt;
		&lt;method name="comp" action="preScript" base="build"/&gt;
		&lt;method name="sim" action="execScript" base="grid"/&gt;
		 ...
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="mygroup" type="group" base="normal-group"&gt;
		&lt;members&gt;
			&lt;member&gt;mytask&lt;/member&gt;
		&lt;/members&gt;
		&lt;execScript&gt;
			&lt;command&gt;vsim -coverage top&lt;/command&gt;
		&lt;/execScript&gt;
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="mytask" type="task"&gt;
	 ...
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	 ...
&lt;/rmdb&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">Assume you are about to launch the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action for
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mytask</span> Runnable.
Note carefully what does not happen. Since the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">comp</span> method
element comes before the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sim</span>method
element in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">normal-group</span> base
Runnable, the conditions on that method are tested first. Given
that the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">comp</span> method
element is conditional on the Action type being <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span>,
it does not match the Action being executed (which, in this example,
is an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>).
The fact that its base method <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">build</span> does
match the conditions of the Action in question is moot since the
base method element is never consulted (since the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">comp</span> method
element did not match in the first place).</p>
<p class="p">Second, the condition on the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span> <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element,
if it were considered, would fail in this case since the Action
script is not being run from under a Runnable called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">anothergroup</span>.
But since the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sim</span> method
in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">normal-group</span> base
Runnable has already matched and has, thus, been selected as the execution
method to be used, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span> </p>
<p class="p">A <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
is only queried for its ability to provide an actual execution method
command to be used. Per the policy on base inheritance, the contents
of the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span> method
element are being treated as if they were defined directly in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sim</span> method
element whose conditional attributes do match the conditions for
the Action in question. The condition attributes of the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span> method
element, however, are not inherited by the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sim</span> method
element because attributes always apply only to the element on which
they are specified. Therefore, the launch command defined in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">grid</span> method
element is used despite its apparent non-match.</p>
<p class="p">Base method elements can be chained. That is,
a base method may refer to another method via its own <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">base</span> attribute.
The search along the base chain continues until a method containing
a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element
is found, at which point the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element containing
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element
becomes the new selected execution method. If no <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
containing a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element
is found in the search along the base chain, then the original <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
(the matching one inside a Runnable) remains the selected execution
method.</p>
<p class="p">In the event that an execution method is selected
but no execution method command can be found, the selected execution
method is used for its attribute values (possibly changing things
like the minimum timeout and the queue selection (see “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="Concept_NamedExecutionQueues_id44b7e485.html#id44b7e485-4cca-45f6-b8ae-15bb6f8f5758__Concept_NamedExecutionQueues_id44b7e485.xml#id44b7e485-4cca-45f6-b8ae-15bb6f8f5758" title="As Actions become eligible to run, they are added to a single internal queue for processing. A background thread then pulls each Action, in turn, from this internal queue and generates the necessary script and wrapper files.">Named Execution Queues</a>” for details) but the Action
itself is launched in the same way it would have been launched had
there been no matching execution method. </p>
<p class="p">With the exception of the conditional attributes
(which, as noted above, only apply to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> elements
occurring inside <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">runnable</span> elements),
all other attribute values (like <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mintimeout</span>)
are read from the selected execution method (that is, from the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
that supplies the execution method command or, lacking an execution
method command, the original matching <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
from inside the Runnable). For example, consider the following RMDB
fragment:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock leveled"><code>&lt;rmdb&gt;
	&lt;method name="b1" mintimeout="20"&gt;
		&lt;command&gt;...command two...&lt;/command&gt;
	&lt;method&gt;
	&lt;method name="b2" mintimeout="35"/&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="mygroup" type="group"&gt;
		&lt;method name="m1" runnable="test1" base="b1" mintimeout="10"&gt;
			&lt;command&gt;...command one...&lt;/command&gt;
		&lt;/method&gt;
		&lt;method name="m2" runnable="test2" base="b1" mintimeout="25"/&gt;
		&lt;method name="m3" runnable="test3" base="b2" mintimeout="30"/&gt;
		&lt;members&gt;
			&lt;member&gt;test1&lt;/member&gt;
			&lt;member&gt;test2&lt;/member&gt;
			&lt;member&gt;test3&lt;/member&gt;
		&lt;/members&gt;
	&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="test1" type="task"&gt;...&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="test2" type="task"&gt;...&lt;/runnable&gt;
	&lt;runnable name="test3" type="task"&gt;...&lt;/runnable&gt;
&lt;/rmdb&gt;</code></pre><p class="p">When the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test1</span> Runnable
executes and a search is made for a matching execution method, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m1</span> is
selected. Since <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m1</span> already
defined an execution method command, no further search is mounted.
The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">base</span> attribute
in <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m1</span> is
moot. The minimum queue timeout used for the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action
defined in Runnable <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test1</span> is
10 seconds, since that attribute is taken from the selected execution
method, represented by <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m1</span>. </p>
<p class="p">When the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test2</span> Runnable
executes, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m2</span> is found
to match. Since this <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element
contains no <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element,
the base methods is searched, starting with <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">b1</span>. The <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">b1</span> contains
a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element
so the search terminates there and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">b1</span> becomes
the selected method element. The minimum queue timeout used for
the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action
defined in Runnable <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test2</span> is
therefore 20 seconds.</p>
<p class="p">When the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test3</span> Runnable
executed, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m3</span> matches
and becomes the selected execution method. However, since <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m3</span> contains
no <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element,
the search continues along the base chain, starting with <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">b2</span>.
In this case, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">b2</span> contains
neither a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">command</span> element
or a <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">base</span> attribute.
Therefore, the command-less <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">method</span> element <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">m3</span>,
being the matching execution method element from inside a Runnable,
becomes the selected execution method. As a result, the minimum
queue timeout used for the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action
defined in Runnable <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test3</span> is
30 seconds.</p>
