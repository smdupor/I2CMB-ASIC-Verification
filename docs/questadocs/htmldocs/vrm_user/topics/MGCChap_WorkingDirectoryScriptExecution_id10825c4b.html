<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Contain_WorkingDirectoryOverview_id9e299a3a.html" title="For any given regression run, each Task or Group of Tasks is assigned a unique working directory and the working directories for the member Groups and/or Tasks within any given Group are created directly under that Group's working directory in a manner reflecting the membership hierarchy defined by the RMDB database. This allows the user scripts to refer to files maintained on behalf of their parent Group (that is, the coverage merge file or design library) via relative path names such as “..” (although that does not preclude the user from passing that information via parameters defined at the Group level). Any files generated by VRM in association with a given Action (that is, Action script files, .do files, log files, and so on) are written to the working directory associated with the Runnable on whose behalf the Action is executed.">Working Directory Overview</a></strong></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Contain_ScriptExecutionTimeouts_idb739d4ac.html" title="Once the RMDB database has been read and the requested Runnables have been expanded to form the execution graph, a completion event is posted to the special =init= Action. This causes one or more Actions to become eligible for execution (that is, their dependencies having been completed). The Actions directly dependent on the =init= Action are generally the preScript Actions of the top-most Group(s) selected via the command line. Actions that are eligible for execution are added to a run queue. An inner loop periodically removes Actions from this queue and executes them. A list of currently executing Actions is also maintained, in which the expected completion time (execution time plus the minimum timeout value for that Action) is recorded. As each Action reports completion, it is removed from the currently executing list and from the graph. The vertices of the graph beginning at the completed node are followed to determine what Actions, if any, can be eligible to run next. If a vertex from the completed Action happens to be the last such vertex into the node at the opposite end, that opposite-end node also becomes eligible to run and is added to the eligible Action run queue.">Script Execution and Timeouts</a></strong></li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Contain_ExecutionMethods_id70589e20.html" title="By default, the wrapper associated with each Action launched by VRM is executed by either vsim or vish as a child process of the initiating VRM process. The exact command used to launch this process depends on the value of the launch attribute of the element associated with the Action. For Actions whose launch attribute is set to vsim (or which do not have a launch attribute, since vsim is the default launch type), the following command is used:">Execution Methods</a></strong></li>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/Contain_FailureRerunFunctionality_ida240963a.html" title="One requirement of a good regression management system is the ability to rerun failed tests, possibly with additional debug output enabled. There are a number of ways in which VRM allows the user to rerun Actions from a previous run according to their status. The most obvious use for this function is to rerun tests that failed, either as is to filter out “noisy” failures or with different command-line options to enable additional debugging output.">Failure Rerun Functionality</a></strong></li>
