<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">In
any single VRM GUI session, there is only a single <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM
Cockpit</span> window. However, there may be any number of <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM
Results</span> windows. Each <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window
is generally associated with a single regression run (regardless
of whether said regression run is currently ongoing or has already
completed). If the regression with which a given <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM
Results</span> window is associated is rerun from the context
menu of the <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window itself, the
same <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window may be “re-purposed”
to monitor the newly launched regression run. If a regression run
is launched by any other means, or if a historical regression run
is opened, a new <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window is invoked.
A <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window may be closed and/or
minimized as the user wishes.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">The bulk of the <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM
Results</span> window consists of a multi-column table where
each row represents either one Runnable or one Action and the first
column is the context string associated with that Runnable or Action.
The first column may be displayed as a hierarchical tree of Runnables
or as a flat list of Actions (this view mode is user-selectable).
When viewing a hierarchical tree of Runnables, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
for each group Runnable may be displayed as children of the Runnable
or not displayed at all (this view mode is also user-selectable).</p>
<p class="p">Note that the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">Empty</span> status
means the Action node could exist in the execution graph but no
script for that particular Action was defined in the RMDB. This
happens mostly with the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
associated with a group Runnable. </p>
<p class="p">When a given table row represents an
Action, the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">Status</span> column
and other columns display various bits of data associated with that
Action. When the row represents a group Runnable (visible in hierarchical mode
only), the other columns are blank. The data columns show, among
other things, the current status of the Action, the times the Action
spent queued and/or executing, the name of the host on which the
Action ran (or is running), the CPU time spent, and other interesting
bits of data. Which columns are populated depends on the current
status of the Action.</p>
<p class="p">Note that the time-related columns (<span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">Queued Time</span>, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">Elapsed Time, Sim Time</span>)
sort in time order rather than lexical order.</p>
<p class="p">Below the Action status table is a row
of counters with an animated “running light” on the left-most side
of the. The running light indicates the state of the overall regression
run (such as Queued, Running, or Passed). The counters indicate
how many Actions exist in each of the listed categories as follows:</p>

<p class="p">The contents of the <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window
are read-only from the user’s point of view and are always associated
with a single regression run. </p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window
for a given regression run only shows those Actions that were part
of the run, according to the pattern of selected Runnables. In the
case where a given <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window is
monitoring an ongoing regression run, new status events are passed
from an internal scoreboard to the <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window.
In the majority of cases, a row corresponding to the Action whose
status is being reported will already exist in the table. However,
in some cases (such as dynamically repeating Runnables), status
may be reported for Actions that were not defined in the original
list. In those cases, the table is reloaded from the scoreboard
in order to place the new row in its proper position in the table
prior to updating its status. </p>
<p class="p">You can alter the view of the Runnables or Actions through the
View menu. Specifically the following options</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li" id="idf8e28a0b-076d-4272-b0a0-b932d1f4461b__ida1d3c875-059c-4884-b637-924a4106f06c"><p class="p">Hierarchical

</ul>
<p class="p">The title of each <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> window
consists of the name of the configuration under which the regression
run is tracked and an optional date-of-launch if the window is monitoring
a regression that was not launched in the current GUI session or
which has completed. For regressions launched from a configuration
entry in the <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Cockpit</span>, only the configuration
name is displayed. For regressions launched manually (that is, from
the initial GUI command line or from the transcript prompt), a new uniquely
named configuration is created and this name is displayed as the
title. For <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Results</span> opened to view the
status of an existing regression listed under the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">History</span> node
of a configuration, the name of the parent configuration and the
