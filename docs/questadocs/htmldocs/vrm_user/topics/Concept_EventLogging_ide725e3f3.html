<p class="p">This event log shows that three leaf-level
Tasks (instances of <span class="ph filepath">execScript</span>) were initiated
and that all three passed. Each was a simulation that resulted in
a UCDB file and the user can construct the absolute paths to these UCDB
files by prepending the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">ucdb-file</span> field
of each done message with the value of the <span class="ph filepath">scratch-dir</span> from
the begin message. Also, it is possible to find the RMDB database
file used for this run by looking at the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">ucdb-file</span> field
of the begin message.</p>
<p class="p">When the TCL wrapper scripts for each Action
are generated by vrun, the <span class="ph filepath">port@host</span> of the
listening TCP/IP socket is hard-coded into the script. However,
when external applications, such as the Runtime GUI, want to connect
to a running vrun process in order to report ongoing status, the <span class="ph filepath">port@host</span> field
of the begin message should be consulted. Since the event logs are
stored in a fixed location relative to the head of the directory,
and since the latest event log file will always be the last file
in a lexical sort of filenames, all the external application needs
to know in order to locate the open TCP/IP port on the vrun process
is the path of the <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory in which the
tests are being executed.</p>
<p class="p">Moreover, since the event logs are always stored
in a fixed location relative to the head of the <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory,
and since an event log is generated for every regression run, the
cumulative event logs can be read in sequence as a single stream
to find out what has run in that <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory
since the directory was created (assuming nobody deleted the log
files without also deleting the entire <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory).
In order to develop a report on the current status of every test
in the suite, the user needs to only read the event log files in
sequence, keeping only the latest status event message for each
Action.</p>
<p class="p">In order to speed up the status reporting process
in this case, at the end of each regression run, the vrun process
checks the event log directory to see how many logs have accumulated.
If more than one log file exists in <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA/logs</span>,
a roll-up file will be created containing the cumulative status
of all Actions to date. The name of the roll-up file follows the
same pattern used for the event log files, save that the extension
used is <span class="ph filepath">.rmup</span>. The roll-up file contains a
verbatim copy of the most recent status event message logged for
each Action (only running and done events are considered). The event
messages are stored in the roll-up file in an arbitrary order. In
order for the roll-up file to appear like an event log, the most
recent begin message from the set of event log files (or a surrogate,
should none of the event logs files contain a begin message) will
precede the Action-related status event messages. A roll-up file
always ends with an end message bearing a timestamp based on when
the roll-up log was created.</p>
<p class="p">To generate a cumulative status report, the
names of the files in the <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA/logs</span> directory
should be lexically sorted. Then, all files prior to the latest
roll-up (.<span class="ph filepath">rmup</span>) file can be discarded (since
the cumulative effect of the event log files prior to that are already
reflected in the latest roll-up file). The files should then be
read in sequence, recording each message in a hash keyed by the context
chain string associated with each status event message (each message
would replace any messages for that Action that were previously
seen). The result can then be sorted as necessary and rendered into
a report.</p>
<p class="p">Note that the contents of the event log generated
during a regression run are identical with the data emitted on the
status channel. Internally, the event log is nothing more than a listener
on the status channel whose socket handle just happens to be a file
handle that is opened for writing any time vrun begins to execute
a regression suite.</p>
