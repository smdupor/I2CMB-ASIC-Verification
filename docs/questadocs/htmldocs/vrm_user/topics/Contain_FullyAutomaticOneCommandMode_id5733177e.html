<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">VRM
supports a single-command automated way to run two passes over a
given regression suite, picking up additional command-line options
on the second pass. The -rerun option takes a string that contains
the additional command-line options for the second pass (which must
be an empty argument should you decide to run the regression suite
twice with the same arguments both times). The command is as follows:</span>
</div>
<p class="lines ApplCommand">vrun<br />
&lt;first-pass-options&gt; -rerun &lt;second-pass-options&gt; &lt;runnable(s)&gt;</p>
<p class="p">For example:</p>
<p class="lines ApplCommand">vrun nightly -Gmode=normal -rerun "-select failed,notrun -Gmode=debug"</p>
<p class="p">In the example above, the regression
suite rooted in the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> Runnable
executes with the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mode</span> parameter
set to <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">normal</span>.
Once that run is complete, the failed and/or un-executed Actions
from the previous run (as well as the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span> and <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span> Actions
from the intermediate Groups) are re-executed with the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">mode</span> parameter
set to <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">debug</span>.
Note that the string passed to the -rerun option is quoted to prevent
the command shell from mistaking it for multiple command-line options.</p>
<p class="p">Prior to executing the second
pass, vrun clears the list of selected Runnables so that only those
Runnables explicitly listed in the -rerun option string are considered
for the second pass. In addition, vrun disables any -runlist option
that may have been passed on the original command line. If no Runnables
are selected by any of the “second pass” options specified in the -rerun
option string, vrun will exit its second pass with the usual “Nothing
to run” error.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, certain options are
blocked when the -rerun option embedded “second pass” options are
being processed. Options such as -rmdb, -vrmdata, and -loadtcl affect
global state and therefore cannot be changed between the original
run and the rerun. Also, the -rerun option itself is blocked from
the “second pass” options.</p>
<p class="p">The options specified in the value
string passed to the -rerun option are parsed in a shell-line way
(honoring embedded single and/or double quotes) and are processed
in the same way as options on the vrun command line itself. With
the exceptions noted above, any options specified on the original
vrun command line remain specified for the second pass unless overridden
by an option in the -rerun option string. Option errors detected
at this point will terminate the rerun but will not invalidate the
results of the original run.</p>
<p class="p">The original run and the second-pass
run share a common event log. That means that any GUI or 3rd party
tools that may be monitoring the progress of the regression run
will see both the original pass/fail status of each Action and then,
later, the updated status of any Actions that were re-executed.
Also, the <span class="ph filepath">RegressionStarting</span> and <span class="ph filepath">RegressionCompleted</span> user-definable
procedures are called only once each for the combined run. The failure
log (enabled by -faillog) may not be useful, as it will contain
the union of all the context paths associated with every test that
failed in either run. A separate status summary is emitted to the
vrun log output for each run and a second “begin” event is logged
to the event log to demarcate the start of the second pass. Validation
and semantic checking of the RMDB file is performed only once at
the start of the vrun invocation.</p>

The simulator guarantees that the same design run twice with the same seed will produce the same results. This is known as “random stability” and is essential to allow bugs exhibited by purely random simulations to be reproduced and debugged. When a series of random simulations are executed for the purpose of locating seeds with good coverage (or which turn up corner-case bugs), it is common to pass the word “random” to the simulation as a seed, as opposed to a fixed numeric seed value. This tells the simulator to select a seed at random at the start of the simulation. Of course, if a test is run twice with the word “random” as the seed, the results of the second run will almost certainly not match the results of the original run.">Reuse of Random Seeds in Automated Rerun</a>” below for information on the

There are a number of ways in which VRM allows the user to rerun Actions from a previous run according to their status.
