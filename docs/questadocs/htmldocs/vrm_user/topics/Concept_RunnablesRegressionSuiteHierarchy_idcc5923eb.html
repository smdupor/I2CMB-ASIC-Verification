<div id="BodyContent"><h1 class="title topictitle1">Runnables and the Regression Suite Hierarchy</h1>
<div class="body conbody ConceptBody"><div class="abstract ConceptAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">VRM views the
entire regression suite as a tree whose leaf-level nodes represent
individual Tasks to be executed. Non-leaf nodes, known as Groups,
can contain zero or more leaf-level Tasks or other Groups as members.
The depth to which Groups can be nested is unlimited. This hierarchical
relationship is a virtual one, reflected only in the membership
lists of the Group nodes. In the database itself, the Group and
Task definitions are stored as a flat list of named and typed <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">runnable</span> elements that
share a single namespace.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">Any given Group or Task can be
a member of any number of Groups at the same time. This can be compared
to the way hierarchy is implemented in Verilog (or VHDL). Verilog <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">module</span> constructs
are stored as a flat list in the HDL source and each one can be
instanced in one or more other modules. Each instance of a given
module is unique, even though the definition of what that module
represents is common to all instances of that module (save for some
limited parameterization capability).</p>
<p class="p">Likewise, in the VRM database, each Group “instances”
one or more Tasks (or other Groups) by name. The definition of each
Runnable item in the hierarchy is stored as a top-level <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">runnable</span> element
in the database. As in the Verilog language, these Runnable items
are highly configurable. Each time a given Runnable item is instanced,
it can draw context data from the instancing Group which will, in
turn, affect the context of any Groups, Tasks, or Action scripts
instanced by that Runnable. Because of this, it is often important
to understand the “parentage” of a given Group or Task with reference
to a given context. As the list of members of each Group is iterated,
a history is maintained as to how each member Runnable came to be
invoked (that is, instanced). This “calling chain” is used as a
search path for Action scripts and parameter values. It is also
used to report the status of any Action scripts. For example, if
a Group called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">nightly</span> contained
a member Group called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">random</span> which,
in turn, contained a member Task called <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">test1</span> that
contained an <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span> Action,
that Action is referred to as <span class="ph filepath">nightly/random/test1/execScript</span> in
any log messages relevant to that Action.</p>
<p class="p">Groups can be sequential or non-sequential.
A sequential Group executes its members in order, launching each
as the previous member completes. A non-sequential Group (the default
if not otherwise specified) executes its members in parallel whenever
possible. The difference is that the Actions in sequential groups
execute in a known order whereas the Actions in non-sequential groups
can be executed in any order. A Group is considered as “sequential”
if the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">sequential</span> attribute
of the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">runnable</span> element
corresponding to the Group in question has a “yes” value. Any other
value, or if such an attribute is not attached to the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">runnable</span> element
at all, results in the Group being treated as a non-sequential Group.</p>
<p class="p">Runnable (Task and Group) names can consist
of any number of alphanumeric characters, underscore (_) characters,
or hyphens (-); except a Runnable name must start with an alphabetic
character or an underscore (not a digit). All other punctuation
is specifically disallowed. These names can be used as arguments
on TCL and shell command lines, in addition to any scripting language
the user may be using for external scripts (Perl, Ruby, and so on)
so the lexical repertoire is intentionally constrained.</p>
