<div id="BodyContent"><h1 class="title topictitle1">Basic Regression
Execution Algorithm</h1>
<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">The
generic VRM use model is relatively simple. The user defines a regression
suite containing an arbitrary number of tests. For convenience,
these tests can be collected into groups, where each group can perform
some action before and after the group's members are executed. The
complete regression suite hierarchy is encoded into a RMDB database.
A single call to VRM can then be used to execute all or part of
the regression suite under specific conditions. Because VRM is expected
to work under various existing regression flows, there are many
opportunities for customizing and/or parameterization.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">In the overall VRM flow, the
user can discern four distinct levels of functionality as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li" id="idcf949f39-e19b-4d3e-8861-e0dd30c9b320__id1ac7486d-1965-4aee-a460-739136c07ef6"><p class="p">At the very top-level, is the vrun
command-line, with all its options, including a recursive “macro”
approach that allows a vrun command line of arbitrary complexity
to be stored inside the RMDB database and invoked via a much shorter
vrun command. A user shell script that calls the vrun utility falls
into this top-most level.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="idcf949f39-e19b-4d3e-8861-e0dd30c9b320__idda85131b-a00b-4a57-9075-1a24c2d06680"><p class="p">The second level of functionality
is the infrastructure of the VRM application. This includes the
algorithm which, based on the contents of the vrun command line
and the RMDB database, decides which Actions should run and when, maintains
the <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory, generates parameter-expanded
script files, and launches jobs. This level is the most complex
and, fortunately, the least likely to vary from one user environment
to the next.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="idcf949f39-e19b-4d3e-8861-e0dd30c9b320__id70940e5e-1bc2-4fd7-b840-a5e88dc6515d"><p class="p">At the very lowest level are the
basic atomic functions. For example, given a UCDB file name, return
the pass/fail status from the testdata record; or given a parameter
name and a context stack, determine the defined value of the parameter. These
things are basic and most users will not benefit from being able
to alter them.</p>
</li>
<li class="li" id="idcf949f39-e19b-4d3e-8861-e0dd30c9b320__id30e5d8e6-fead-4a7d-aa68-809e798608c7"><p class="p">In between the reinforced infrastructure
and the atomic functions, there exists a whole range of behaviors
that vary from user to user. Functions like: “tell me whether a
given test passed or failed” or “should I delete the <span class="ph filepath">VRMDATA</span> directory
for a given test upon completion.” For these functions, a plug-in
like architecture is used where the users can write their own code
to implement these specific behaviors, overriding the default behavior
built into VRM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The VRM implementation consists
of the following major functional elements:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li" id="idcf949f39-e19b-4d3e-8861-e0dd30c9b320__id880289b7-427e-454f-9b47-c67877391646"><p class="p">RMDB database.</p>
<p class="p">The RMDB database describes the hierarchical
tree of tasks and groups of tasks. The grouping can be nested to
any depth, allowing the user to subdivide the regression suite as
necessary. The hierarchy of the tree determines the inter-dependence
of the various tasks and the nodes of the tree define the Action
scripts that will become the “jobs” executed as part of the regression
suite. The content of the database is completely parameterizable
and can be configured to invoke the user's existing run scripts
in addition to defining run commands from scratch. Refer to “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_RmdbDatabaseTopology_id46a4dcaa.html#id46a4dcaa-220c-4e20-8015-5d0c86eb8a88__MGCChap_RmdbDatabaseTopology_id46a4dcaa.xml#id46a4dcaa-220c-4e20-8015-5d0c86eb8a88" title="The RMDB database contains the information required to expand one or more selected Tasks or Groups of tasks, invoked by name on the command line, into one or more individual Actions that are to be executed.">RMDB Database Topology</a>” for detailed information.</p>

<p class="p">The parameter expansion engine supports
the parameterization of Action scripts and certain attributes in
the RMDB database. Parameter values can also contain nested references
to other parameters, making the entire database more flexible. It
is common for many Tasks (tests) in a typical regression suite to
share the same basic command set with some modifications unique
to each Task (such as a plusarg argument, a stimulus file name,
or a seed value). The parameterization functionality of VRM allows
the common parts of the commands to be defined once with Task-specific
parameters defined where needed. Refer to “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_ParametersParameterExpansion_id68da1844.html#id68da1844-ab5a-4671-86d0-234a9b5ae99e__MGCChap_ParametersParameterExpansion_id68da1844.xml#id68da1844-ab5a-4671-86d0-234a9b5ae99e" title="Each Runnable definition (that is, each runnable element) can include a list of zero or more parameter element definitions. A parameter is nothing more than a name/value pair that allows multiple Tasks to share the same execution script (or multiple Groups to share the same Task) by providing unique per-Group or per-Task values to be used in the scripts.">Parameters and Parameter Expansion</a>” for detailed information.</p>

<p class="p">For any given regression run, each
Task or Group of Tasks is assigned a unique working directory and
the working directories for the member Groups and/or Tasks within
any given Group are created directly under that Group's working
directory in a manner reflecting the membership hierarchy defined
by the RMDB database. Refer to “<a class="xref fm:HeadingAndPage" href="MGCChap_WorkingDirectoryScriptExecution_id10825c4b.html#id10825c4b-4904-44a4-85d7-7377d002bb59__MGCChap_WorkingDirectoryScriptExecution_id10825c4b.xml#id10825c4b-4904-44a4-85d7-7377d002bb59" title="In order to prevent multiple Actions (that is, user scripts) from a single vrun invocation from overwriting or otherwise interfering with each other, each Action executed by VRM is launched from within a working directory unique to the Runnable on whose behalf the Action is launched. In order to prevent multiple invocations of VRM (by other users or by the same user) from interfering with each other, the root of the scratch hierarchy within which these per-Runnable directories are created is control by the user.">Working Directory and Script Execution</a>” for detailed information.</p>

<p class="p">The task launch algorithm and job progress
monitoring manage the execution of the Actions defined within the
regression suite. Internal queues are maintained for those Actions
that are eligible to run and those that are currently running. VRM
tracks and reports the status of the Actions for each run. Refer
to <a class="xref fm:HeadingOnly" href="Concept_JobProgressMonitoring_idbcdb4418.html#idbcdb4418-97cf-433d-92ec-6283e2565aed__Concept_JobProgressMonitoring_idbcdb4418.xml#idbcdb4418-97cf-433d-92ec-6283e2565aed" title="The VRM algorithm can be divided into two basic functions. The first, somewhat trivial function is to build a list of Actions that need to be executed. This happens once when VRM is first executed. The second, more complex function is to listen for job completions and kick off subsequent rounds of Actions as they become eligible to run. This second function is mainly triggered in response to a “done” message being received from an existing job (exceptions are made for the initial round of eligible Actions that are triggered by a synthetic “done” message on the pseudo-Action =init= and for timeouts, which are handled as if a “done” message had occurred but in response to the lapse of a preset time interval).">Job Progress Monitoring</a> below.</p>
