		uplevel #0 exec $command
	}
}</code></pre><p class="p">As you can see, the multi-Action wrapper first
looks for the MTI_VRUN_JOBIDX_ENV environment variable. If this
variable is set, it indicates that vrun believes the Grid Management system
supports array jobs and that such an array job has, in fact, been
submitted. It is assumed (by design, in fact) that the environment
variable named in the MTI_VRUN_JOBIDX_ENV environment variable contains
the specific index of the Action to be executed with each invocation.
In the supported Grid Management systems, this index is one-based
(that is, starts at one and increments to the upper limit of the
array). Therefore, it subtracts one when choosing the Action to
execute. The commands in the list are the same commands that would
have been placed into the execution method wrapper (.<span class="ph filepath">bat</span>)
if the Action were executed separately. </p>
<p class="p">If the MTI_VRUN_JOBIDX_ENV environment variable
is not found, then the multi-Action wrapper assumes that the Actions
in the list should be executed in sequence, as would happen in a
fixed-list clubbed job. In fact, the same multi-Action wrapper script
is used for grid array jobs and fixed-list clubbed jobs.</p>
<p class="p">One of the Actions in the clubbed list is selected
as the “proxy” Action. The multi-Action job control script and that
script’s stdout and stderr output logs are written to the task directory associated
with the proxy Action. The job ID returned by the grid submission
command is associated with the proxy Action. All other Actions that
were clubbed together with the proxy Action are annotated with the
proxy Actions context string to make job control feasible.</p>
<p class="p">The multi-Action job control script is named
by combining the base name of the proxy Action (that is, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">preScript</span>, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">execScript</span>, <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">postScript</span>,
and so on) with an extension of <span class="ph filepath">.multi</span>. The
remaining files, such as the wrapper (<span class="ph filepath">.wrap</span>)
and script (<span class="ph filepath">.do</span>) files, are generated for each
Action as usual.</p>

By default, Action scripts (preScript, execScript, postScript, and others) are launched as child processes on the local machine. The RMDB file can specify execution methods for all or a select group of Actions that cause the Action scripts to be launched in a user-specified manner. This can be used to launch remote processes on specific servers, to wrap a given Action script in another script, or to submit the Action script for execution on a compute grid or server farm. The user only needs to provide a template for the command necessary to launch a given script and vrun will follow the instructions set by the user when launching the scripts associated with that execution method.">Controlling Grid Jobs</a>” for additional information.</p>

However, because the grid queuing process involves some overhead, it is sometimes more efficient to combine two or more short-running Actions into a single grid job submission. A multi-Action grid job is created when several eligible Actions are clubbed together into a single script that is launched as a single job on a compute grid. Generation of multi-Action jobs is controlled on a per-queue basis. Each named queue is configured via attributes attached to the method element that creates the named queue and that queue’s settings apply to any Action which is launched via that named queue.">Aggregating Multiple Actions in a Single Job</a></div>
