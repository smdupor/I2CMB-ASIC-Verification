<div id="BodyContent"><h1 class="title topictitle1">VRM Cockpit Window</h1>
<div class="body MGCBody"><div class="abstract ContainerAbstract"><span class="shortdesc">When
a VRM GUI session first opens, assuming a regression run is not
also being launched by the same vrun command, the only window initially visible
is the VRM Cockpit window. This window displays the contents of
the currently loaded project file, including the RMDB files in use
by the project and the pre-canned configurations attached to each
RMDB file. This window also supports the creation of new configurations,
the importation of regression run history from one or more <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directories,
the launching of new regression runs, and the opening of a VRM Results
window for viewing the results of previously launched regression runs.</span>
</div>
<p class="p">There is only one VRM Cockpit
per VRM GUI session and only one project file can be loaded at any
one time (although there is no limit to how many project files a user
can create and maintain).</p>
<p class="p">Each configuration is associated with
a single RMDB file and calls out a single <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory.
Once a configuration is created, the RMDB with which the configuration
is associated cannot be changed. However, the <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
setting can be edited via the <span class="ph uicontrol">Edit VRM Configuration</span> window.
If the <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory setting for a given
configuration is changed, the user is given a choice of using the
new setting as is (and possibly creating a new <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
if one does not already exist at that location) or renaming the
previous <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory to match the newly
specified path. </p>
<p class="p">Note that if the <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
setting for a given configuration is changed, there may be no way
to view the history contained within the previous <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
in the GUI unless the directory is renamed or some other configuration
also refers to that same <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory.</p>
<p class="p">Each <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
contains its own history. A single <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
can be used by more than one configuration (though that is not necessarily
a recommended practice). By default, the GUI attempts to avoid overlapping <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directories
by auto-generating a unique path for <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory
with each new configuration (which can be changed by the user). </p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">VRM Cockpit</span> window
display is a hierarchical browser populated with various kinds of
data. The top-most level shows a list of the RMDB files registered
in the project file. Under each RMDB entry is a list of named configurations associated
with that RMDB. Under each configuration is a single node representing
the <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory used by that configuration.</p>

<p class="p">Under the <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory

(see <a class="xref fm:Figure" href="#idda370666-7f02-4a4a-8427-16a9b18bde86__id5c7f685d-a4ee-4c80-bb00-eeb222219042">Figure 1</a>), along with a listing of every file
and subdirectory contained within the top-level <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory.
These files and directory rows act as regular file browser entries, allowing
the user to push down into the working directory of any Runnable
in the regression suite that has been executed at least once in
this <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory.</p>
<p class="p">Under the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">History</span> row
is a single entry for each regression run executed in this <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory.
Each of these entries is tied to the Status Event Log for a single
regression run.</p>
<p class="p">Note that every Status Event Log under
a given <span class="ph filepath">VRM Data</span> directory is represented as
an entry under the <span class="ph FontProperty emphasis">History</span> row, even
if the regression run which created that Status Event Log was not
initiated from the configuration under which it appears. Moreover,
since regressions can be launched with one-time configuration changes
and the user can edit the configurations at any time, there is no guarantee
that each of the historical runs listed under a given configuration
were run with the same set of command-line options. Each Status
Event Log carries a record of the exact command-line options and
Runnable selections used to launch that specific regression run
and the GUI supports launching a new regression run using the exact
options used in a previous run. Therefore, the association of historical
regression logs with specific configurations should be considered
nothing more than an organizational convenience.</p>
