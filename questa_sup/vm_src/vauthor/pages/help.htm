<h3>VRM Input Tool Help</h3>

<p>
To create a new regression suite, go to the Home page and press the "Define New
Regression Suite" button. Enter a name in the popup dialog and select one of the
available templates from the drop-down selector. Press "Save" to create the new
regression suite.</p>

<p>
Click on the link corresponding to the regression suite you want to modify or
generate. The left-side nvigation bar will be populated with one or more menu
items corresponding to the various data-entry pages. Each one should have a
"Help" button in the upper-right corner of the data-entry pane which will give
more detailed instructions pertaining to that specific data-entry page.</p>

<p>
When the regression suite has been configured as required, press the "Generate"
menu item at the bottom of the left-side navigation bar. A tarfile containing
the files needed to run the regression will be generated and downloaded to the
browser. Unpack that file into a clean directory and type "vrun" to launch the
regression run.</p>
